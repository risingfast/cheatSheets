    Overview
        ASP is Active Server Pages and comprises HTML pages with embedded scripting
        ASP.net uses compiled VB.net or C#.net and not scripts - ASP and ASP.net are different
        ASP can be used to create dynamic database connected webpages
    Server Handling of .ASP pages
        If an ASP page is requested, the http server passes the request to a registered .asp engine
        The .asp engine runs the embedded scripts in the html page and ignores any html blocks
        The .asp engine writes any display lines from the code to memory
        The .asp engine merges the display lines back with the html blocks and gives it to the webServer to serve up
    Allowed Scripts
        Any .COM compliant (Component Object Model) scripting language is supported
            JavaScript, PERL, vbScript, JScript and others
            COM components are secured executables compliled as DLL's
            COM can be written in any language that supports it (eg C# or VB)
    Syntax and Page Setup
        The first non-comment line should declare the script handler
            <%@ Language=VBScript %> or <%@ Language=JavaScript %> are examples
        Script is delimited by <% and %> directly in the html code. 
            Whitespace is ignored
            The same delimiters are used regardless of the script language
    Request Object
        The Request object contains all the information sent by the requesting page
            Information is organized in "collections of data within the Request object
        Collections include:
            ClientCertificate: The values of fields stored in the client certificate that is sent in the HTTP request. 
            Cookies: The values of cookies sent in the HTTP request. 
            Form: The values of form elements in the HTTP request body. 
            QueryString: The values of variables in the HTTP query string. 
            ServerVariables: The values of predetermined server/environment variables.
        The syntax of the request object is:
            Request[.collection|property|method](variable)
        All request variables can be accessed directly without prefixing the collection
            Use "request.<variablename> to get the value of each item
            The order of search through the collections is:
                Querystring, Form, Cookies, ClientCertificate, ServerVariables
    Using the SQL Server Database
        Replace any single quotes with two single quotes prior to buidling SQL strings
            Strings must have single quotes around variables so single quotes in text need protection
            Two adjacent single quotes is equivalent to one single quote

                FOR /F "TOKENS=1" %g IN ('HOSTNAME') DO (ECHO %g) -- store the hostname in %g%
                FOR /F "TOKENS=1" %g IN ("This is a string") DO (ECHO %g)
                FOR /F "DELIMS=" %%g in ("!String!") DO (ECHO %%g)-- for a string variable
                FOR /F "tokens=*" %%g IN ('hostname') do (SET Host=%%g) -- assigns the output of the hostname command to the variable %Host% in a script (requires %%g)
    Entering Multiple and Conditional Commands
        Use & and && and || for running multiple commands or running a command if another fails
            If the first command fails then the second command will run
        & run both commands
        && run the second command if the first succeeds
        || run the second command if the first fails
    COPY
        Copy from the console to create a file with "copy con samplefile.txt" and used ctrl-Z to send an eof
            Concate to an existing file from the console with "copy <existingfile.txt>+con"
            Add text to a file direcly from the console using "echo "some words of text" >> <textfile.txt>>
        Concatenating Files
            Use the copy command with a "+" between each file name to concatenate all files into the first file
            Or specify a target file w/out a plus sign eg copy a.txt+b.txt+c.txt target.txt
    POPD/PUSHD
        Enter pushd <directory> to change to a directory and push the new directory onto a stack
        Enter popd to pop the most recent pushd directory off the stack and change back to that directory
        Set the promt to $p$g (i.e. prompt $p$g) to see the directory changes as part of the prompt
    FINDSTR
        Use the format 'findstr /options "expression" <infile> > <outfile>
        Prints to console if <outfile> is not given
        "expression" is a regex
        Use double quotes for spaces in expressions and not single quotes
            single quotes are considered part of the expression
        Use /b to match expressions to the beginning of lines in a file    
        Use wildcards for filenames to match in multiple files
            findstr will prefix the filename to the result lines
        Use /s to search subdirectories recursively
        Use /f:<filename> to read filenames from a file - omit the file spec at the end of the command
        Use /g:<filename> to read expressions from a file for matching - omit the expression clause of the command
    Program Files Synonyms
        PROGRA~1 for C:\Program Files (environment variable ProgramFiles - to eliminate spaces)
        PROGRA~2 for C:\Program Files (x86) (environment variable ProgramFiles(x86) - to eliminate spaces)

        General Rules
            Batch commands are intended to be used in batch files but can be used at the console prompt
            Non batch DOS commands are commonly used at the command prompt but also applicable to batch files
            Any command line string can be included in a batch file
            Use F3 to repeat the previous command on the command line
            Case does not matter - upper and lower case are treated equally
            Blank lines are ignored by the interpreter and are for formatting only
            Literal strings are not quoted, eg if %1 == Happy (..) is OK and so is if "%1" == "Happy" ...
            Commands are separated by newlines but using () can group multiple lines into a single command
            Use double quotes working with directory paths with spaces
        Getting Help
            Type "help <cmd>" at the command line
        Running Batch Commands
            Run at the command line by typing the filename 
                Alternatively type filename.bat or filename.cmd - either are allowed
        Setting the Command Prompt
            Shorten the command prompt with the PROMPT= command
                eg  PROMPT=$P - sets to the current drive path
                    PROMPT=$$ - sets it to '$'
                    PROMPT=$ - sets it to a blank
                Other values are $G (Greater than), $D (Date), $N (Drive), $B (Pipe)
                Multiple values can be strung together for a compound prompt
        Batch Commands
            :: - comment or remark that is not echoed to the console (skipped by the interpreter)
            @ - suppresses the current line from printing (use with @echo off)
            %1 %2 etc - command line parameters replaced dynamically but including any quotes (eg echo %1) and %~1 has quotes removed
            call batfile arglist - calls another batch file and passes arguments
            Echo Off|On - suppresses following lines from printing, or restores printing
            Echo Message - displays a message on the screen
            Echo. <Message> - displays a blank line after an optional message (echo. displays a blank line)
            Endlocal - cancels a Setlocal and drops local environment variables
            Exit - terminates the program
            For %%v in (set) do command %%v - loops through values in a list and executes a command with each value
            LABEL is a colon - go to a label marked :LABEL (eg.. goto here .... :here). Must be the first column on the line w/out whitespace
                Only the first 8 characters are used. Whitespaces in the label are allowed
            if [not] Exist <file> <cmd> - executes cmd if file exists
            if [not] text1 == text2 <cmd> - executes if values are equal
            if [not] text1 == text2 (cmds) else (cmds)
            Pause - prompts the user, pauses and waits for a key to continue
            Popd - changes to the last saved directory path (previously saved by a Pushd)
            Pushd <path> - saves the current directory on a stack and moves to <path>
            Rem or REM - marks a remark line. Read by the interpreter and echoed to the console
            Setlocal - creates a local copy of environment variables for a batchfile's liftime
            Shift - shifts the command line arguments left one position (%2 is moved to %1). Used to access arguments > 10
            Start - starts an executable program in a separate window (allows a datafile target also)
            Title - sets the title of the command box window
        Command Line Variables or Arguments
            %0, %1, %2, %3 .. %9 etc are read from the command line when the batchfile is run ... e.. c:\test\mybat.bat var1 var2 var3
            %0 is always the name of the batch file
        Program Variables and Data Types
            Variable names comprise numbers letters and underscors and cannot begin with a number
            SET var1=Value .. sets var1 to 'Value'. Print using echo %Var1% and use the /A option to set numerics ... SET /A num1=5
        Environment Variables and General Variables
            SET to list all system/environment variables
            %abc% is a generate variable value (e.g. SET abc="Hello", then ECHO %abc% to print the value
            %var% returns an environment variable: eg echo %username%
            New variables can be defined with SET: eg set myenv=buttons (env is %myenv%)
            %~nx0 -- the script file name
            %COMSPEC% -- the path to cmd.exe
            %HOMEPATH% -- users home on the file system
            %RANDOM% -- a random number 5 digits
        Command Line Commands to Include in Batch Files
            Type - same as cat in Linux - echos contents of a file (also use > to redirect)
        For Statement
            Use the FOR statement to step through the lines and a file and conditionally process each line
        Sample Commands
            echo %path% >> c:\temp\path.txt -- write the Windows path to a text file
        Debugging
            run with redirect e.g. test.bat > testout.txt 2>&1 to redirecto all output to a file testout.txt
        Functions
            Use labels to name functions
            Use call :FuncName to call a function.
            Use goto :eof to end a called function and return to the calling block (end of function)
            If you use goto :FuncName and goto :eof it will go to the end-of-file
            Pass variables spaced in the call e.g. :FuncName var1 var2 and reference in the function with %~1, %~2 etc
            Use SETLOCAL and ENDLOCAL within a function to limit scope on variables
        Examples
            dir /s Archive | findstr Directory ... run from root to find all Archive directories and print each path
            ForFiles /p "C:\Users\gjarman\Documents\Computing\Oracle\Notes\Archive" /d -120 /c "cmd /c del @file" -- delete all files older than 120 days in an archive directory
            VER | FIND "Windows NT" || echo Not Windows NT -- echo Windows NT not found if VER does not include the string
            FSUTIL fsinfo volumeinfo d: | findstr /B "File System Name : FAT32" && SET fs=FAT32 -- check if a drive is FAT32 which cannot handle large files
            wmic os get serialnumber|find "-" -- get the serial number of a computer
            set tm=%tm: =0% -- change blank spaces to zeroes in a string %tm%
            IF ERRORLEVEL 1 <COMMAND> -- executes <command> when errorlevel is set to 1 by last executed command
            IF %var1% EQU %var2% echo var1 and var2 match
            FOR /F "DELIMS=*" %i IN (commands.txt) DO %i -- run each line in a file as a command

    Profiles
        Profiles store locally scoped definitions for reuse
        Profiles are maintained at four levels
            %windir%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\profile.ps1
            %windir%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\ Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

        Parentheses control the order of evaluation
            Everything within the () parentheses is evaluated as a single unit
        Scope
            Variables defined within an instance of a script or session only exist within that context
                These variables are discarded when the session or script ends
    Variables
        Variables are designated with a leading $
            e.g. $Var1 = 'Hello' (and $Var1 will print the contents)
            e.g. $Array1 = 1,2,3,4,5 (and $Array1[0] will print the first value 1
            e.g. $Array2 = 'One','Two','Three','Four','Five' (and $Array2[1] will print 'Two'
        Negative Array references start at the end and -1 is the final value
            e.g. $Array3 = 7,8,9 and $Array3[-1] will print 9
        Use single-quotes for text and double-quotes for test that include variable names
            e.g. $t1 = 'everyone'; $t2 = "Hello $t1", and $t2 will print 'Hello everyone'
        Double-quotes containing single quotes treat the single quotes as literals
            e.g. $string1 = "These single quotes '' are OK"
        Escape is ` (the back-tick or grave)
            e.g. $t3 = 'text'; $t3="`$t3 is not text"; $t3 will print '$t2 is not text'
            Get-Help about_escape_characters 
            Escape can assign special meaning to characters
                `0    Null
                `a    Alert
                `b    Backspace
                `f    Form feed
                `n    New line
                `r    Carriage return
                `t    Horizontal tab
                `v    Vertical tab
            Escape can continue a line
                e.g. Get-Process '
                     >> Powershell -- is the same as Get-Process Powershell
        Properties
            Variables can have properties which are referenced with a . operator
                e.g. $Var9 = Get-Service
                     $Var9[20].name -- gives the name of service 21
                     $var9[20].name.toupper() -- gives the name of service21 in uppercase
                     $var9 | format-list -- shows everything

        Windows Administration Scripting Guide - 
    Getting Started
        Scripts are placed in files ending .vbs (eg "testscript.vbs") and run from the command line
        Run as either cscript textscript.vbs or wscript textscript.vbs to run windows or DOS box versions
            cscript is the 'console' script host or interpreter
            wscript is the 'windows' script host - it is invoked automatically from within Windows to run scripts
    Introduction
        Windows script and WMI is the primary language for managing Windows servers and resources
        VBScript is a 'glue' language for accessing and tying together Automation Objects (including WMI objects)
        Connecting to an object is 'binding' which instantiates an object of a class (e.g. Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:"))
        GetObject() should be used to bind an object to ADSI or WMI
        CreateObject() should be used to bind an object to any object other than WMI or ADSI (eg FileSystems, Dictionaries, Internet Explorer)
        'Set' must be used to create an object reference but cannot be used for any other assignment
        Any language supporting the COM standard can be used to script WMI (eg ActivePerl)
        WMI can be used to monitor events in real time using 'event subscriptions'
    Tips and Tricks
        Using "save as" in Notepad - surround the filename with double quotes to prevent Notepad adding the .txt extension
        Scripts are not case sensitive
        whitespaces between arguments on the command line are ignored 
        Functions are available based on the script language used. If the script is vbScript, use vb functions
    Microsoft Script Editor
        Available choice when running a script in //D debug mode
    Microsoft Script Debugger
        Can be found by searching the Microsoft Download Center using "Script Debugger"
        Installs into "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Script Debugger" directory
        Creates an installation entry in the Control Panel "Add Remove Programs Listing"
        //D option = invoke debugging on an error by running a script in debug mode using //D eg "wscript //D myscript.vbs"
        //X option = invoke debugging automatically on the first statement using the //X option (even if no error)
    Namespaces
        root\cimv2
    Sample Simple Scripts
    Definitions
        Automation Objects - COM objects that provide access to Microsoft Applications like Work, Excel and Outlook (methods and properties)
    Acroynms
        ADSI - Active Directory Services Interface
        COM - Component Object Model (standard ways to expose services that can be called by scripts)
        DLL - Dynamic Link Library programming libraries
        HTA - HTML Application (such as Scriptomatic)
        SWbem - Scripting Web Based Enterprise Manager
        WMI - Windows Management Instrumentation (a set of COM objects to expose Windows OS services to scripts) - implements WBEM
        WSH - Windows Script Host
        WBEM - Web Based Enterprise Management - an industry standard for enterprise management component access
        DMTF - Distributed Management Task Force - standards body guiding the development of WMI
        CIM - Common Information Model - repository of services and providers implemented as a schema
        CIMOM - CIM Object Manager
    Data Types in Visual Basic Script
        Data types are: Boolean, Byte, Integer, Long, Single, Double, String, Date, Empty, Object and Error
        'Dim' is used to explicitly declare a variable (e.g. 'Dim myString, myCount, myDate')
            'Dim' should not be used in combination with a variable initialization - it will throw an error
                e.g. Dim strMyString = "Foobar" will throw an error
                You can use the multi-statement separater instead (i.e. the colon ":")
                  e.g. Dim strMyString : strMyString = "Foobar"
        All dimensioned data is type variant - it is not strictly typed until it is used
        'Option Explicit' forces checking of variable declarations by the interpreter (i.e. to prevent typos)
        Booleans are True and False with True represented internally as "-1" (not "1) and false as "0"
    Comments
        ' is used to identify a comment (i.e. a single quote)
        The quote can appear anywhere on the line, or on its own line
    WMI Objects, Methods and Properties    
        There are a dozen or so objects in WMI that have methods providing access to the WMI infrastructure via methods
            Methods return collections of managed objects include 'instanceOf' and 'execQuery' where the object type is part of the call argument
                e.g. objWMIService = objWMIService.execQuery("Select * From WIn32_Service")
            Each instance is a virtual representation of a Windows managed resource.
            The WMI providers such as 'Win32_Service' are defined as DLL's in the host %SystemRoot%\system32\wbem directory
        Methods 
            GetObject()
            Get() method
    CIMON Broker (Common Information Model (CIM) Object Manager (OM))
        CIMON is the broker between Script languages and the underlying instrumentation providers. It serves multiple roles:
            Provider Registration - maintains a list of all providers and their call features
            Request Routing - manages connections between scripts and underlying providers
            Remote Access - allows remote connections to serve up data
            Security - limites access to the provider functions
            Query Processing - processes queries to return collections of objects and properties
            Event Processing - allows scripts to subscribe to events
        Namespaces group object defintions into related groups. 
            The main namespace is root\cimv2 which stores common windows (cimv2 is Common Information Model Version 2)
        WMI Tester (wbemtest.exe) and WMI Command Line (wmic.ext) allow browsing the namespace schemas and running WMI commandline actions
            See MS Help for additional details.
        CIM Studio (Part of the WMI SDK) is a graphical user interface for browsing and interacting with the WMI assets 
    Scriptomatic
        Scriptomatic is an HTA application that allows you to select a namespace and class to generate base code 
        The code that is generated displays all the properties in the class and provides a template for using the class
    COM Namespaces and Objects
        root\CIMV2\Win32_Service - extracts currently running services, names and resource usages
        root\CIMV2\Win32_Process - extracts currently running processes, names and resource usages
        Win32_BIOS - extracts information about the BIOS
    Built In WScript Objects
        WshShell
        WshNetwork
        WshContoller
        WScript - the primary object with methods to bind to other objects and report basic properties
    vbScript Formatting Characters
        vbTab - represents a tab character that can be echoed 
        vbNewLine - represents a newline that can be echoed 
        vbCRLF  - windows newline character same as vbNewLine
    vbScript String Functions
        inStr() - returns the position of a string within another string
        ucase() - convert a string to upper case
        lcase() - convert a string to lower case
    Displaying Results on a Screen
        WScript.echo() - simple text boxes
        MsgBox - boxes with buttons
        PopUp - customizable titles

            Solution Explorer (script storage and control)
    Getting Started
        The process sqlservr.exe must be running under task manager (with user Name 'NETWORK SERVICE)
            You can also check under SQL Server Configuration Manager
        Startup log files are at C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Setup Bootstrap\Log
    Connections and Connection Problems
        The default connection method is shared memory. TCP is for remote host connections
        Change connection method to named pipes if you get SSPI context errors
    Servers and Databases
        A connection/server is a single running instance of SQL Server with it's associated tables
        Server groups organize registered servers into groups (eg. all express servers in one group)
        Each Server instance has five system databases: master, model, tempdb, msdb and resource (hidden)
            Master: stores all system level information for a server instance
            Model: used by SQL Server agent for scheduling jobs and alerts
            MSDB: used as a template for creating new databases under the server instance
            Temp: an area for holding temporary or intermediate results
            Resource: a hidden database containing system objects. 
    Database Files
        .mdf files - hold the database tables
        .ldf files - hold the logs - to recover lost transactions
    Users, Roles and Logins
        Security is managed by creating server logins, and then database users for that login
        Server logins manage access to the server, and db user accounts allow access to specific databases
            SQL Logins are server level logins that have access privileges to the SQL Server objects
        Windows accounts can be mapped to SQL Server login accounts for validation
        SQL Users - are local SQL accounts with only database access privileges
            You create a user at the db level by right-clicking 'Security' under a database
        Role based security is the recommended way of assigning privileges to users
            Privileges are assigned to roles and users are assigned to roles
        Defining a new login won't work unless mixed authentication is turned on in server properties
    Basic Navigation
        Use the Summary Page for faster navigation - not the tree view
        Keyboard customization and shortcuts are under Tools/Options/Keyboard
        Standard config is Visual Studio - SQL Server 2000 is for SQL Server config
    Views
        Right click on 'Views' to show the view builder
        Use views as stored queries
        Filter wildcards are '%'
        Columns can be suppressed from output and synonyms can be declared
    Running Scripts
        Start scripts with the USE <database name> GO clause to point to the right database
            The USE directive ensures the query will run in the proper database
        Highlight a portion of a script to run only that portion
        Use F5 to execute
        Use the comment-out button to comment out portions of a script (Same as Visual Studio)
        Right click and choose 'Results To' to change the export format to text or file
    Script Templates
        Show templates from the view menu or Ctrl-Alt-T
        Click the 'Replace Parameters' button to substitute actual variables in the template
            This button looks like an 'A -> B' logo on the button bar
    Transact SQL
        Transact SQL is the SQL implementation for communicating with SQL Server
        http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms365303(SQL.90).aspx
    Unicode Notation
        Target strings in where clauses may be expressed with a 'N' prefix (eg. ... where name = N'Jane')
            The 'N' prefix denotes that the target literal is in unicode format
    Comments
        Use /* .... */ to comment out blocks of code
        Use -- to comment out lines or remainder of lines
        The toolbar has a block comment, unblock comment icon for blocking out multiple lines conveniently
    Schema Reporting
        sp_help <table_name> creates a database schema report for a table
    Database Schema Tables
        sysobjects - objects (including tables) in database
        syscolumns - columns in tables
    Surface Area Configuration
        Manages server security - most external access to services are turned off by default
        SQL Server Browser must be turned on to access a SQL Server instance from the network
            It provides name resolution to incoming requests through port 1433
            Named pipe communication is through \sql\query
    SQL Server Manager
        Manages services and internal configurations of the server
    Database Backup and Recovery
        A database can be backed up by detaching the mdf file and copying it to another location
            Right click on a database and choose Task/Detach
            Files are normally located under the SQL Server Program Top
            e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Data - contains all mdf files by default
            The actual file location can be found in the 'files' page from a database property window.
        Alternatively use the Backup Dialog box (right click on a database and choose tasks/backup)
            Backups are saved to the default installation folder which can be changed through backup setup options
            e.g. c:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Backup\
            You can point to a named backup device in the backup configuration instead of a file
            Backup devices are defined/named under Server Objects/Backup Devices on the Object Navigation pane
    Schema
        Set of database entities that form a single namespace - can be a user name or separate/independently defined
        Tables within the same schema cannot have the same name
        In SQL 2000 a user name and a schema are equivalent - creating a user creates a schema
            Dropping database users does not require dropping all objects in the users' schema
        Fully qualified object names are server.database.schema.object
        Users have a default schema when they are created. 
            Objects are searched starting in the default schema, and then to the dbo schema
        With user/schema separation, schema can be owned by roles rather than individual users
        There are several standard schemas in SQL Server 2005 that correspond to certain db roles or users
            users: dbo, guest, INFORMATION_SCHEMA, and sys, 
            roles: db_owner, db_accessadmin, db_securityadmin, db_dlladmin, db_backupoperator, 
                db_datareader, db_datawriter, db_denydatareader, and db_denydatawriter
    Creating Tables
        You can create a key on a table column by clicking the key icon 
            or right click in the pane and select the key icon
        You can define a sequence by setting Identity to 'Yes' in the field properties
            this allows you to choose the increment and seed values
            only numeric data

    Reminders
        Put declarations in class member variables but put initializations in constructors or other methods
    Basic Statements
        You can dimension a variable only at the module or procedure level
        Variables declared at module level are class members, whereas variables declared within a procedure are local
            Variable declared within a codebloc have scope only within the block - they are private to the outside
            Variables declared at the module level have access modifiers so the 'Dim' keyword is implied
        You cannot instantiate a variable or object outside a procedure unless it is shared
        Dim is implied when access modifiers are used such as Private, Public, Friend or Protected
        Dim <variable> As <variableType> = <value> e.g. Dim myInteger As Integer = 1
        Dim <objectName> As <class> = New <class>()
        Public/Protected/Private Function <myFunction>(args) As <ReturnType> <codeblock> End Function
        Public/Protected/Private Sub <mySub>(args) <codeblock> End Sub
        Public <PropertyName> as <datatype>Get <codeblock> End Get, Set <codeBlock> End Set
    Code Snippets
        Demo at http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=126728
        Demo solution - CodeSnippets.sln
        Use right click/snippet picker or ?<tab> to bring up the snippet picker
            Also type the shortcut directly (e.g. colcreatekey) and <tab>
        Replacement code is in green with help hovering over the green code
        Hit <ctrl><space> to get a list of substitute items
        Also type the start of a shortcut and tab to get all snippets matching what was typed
        Snippets are XML files renamed to .snippet
            The XML file includes any imports needed for the snippet to work
            Invoking a snippet automatically invokes the associated import into the application
        Snippets can be defined or edited in the Code Snippets Manager (navigation = menu/tools/code snippets manager)
    Conversion and Casting
        ms-help://MS.VSExpressCC.v80/MS.NETFramework.v20.en/dv_vbalr/html/1cdacd21-ba31-4b62-b5be-395e41eeaa17.htm
        ctype(expression, type) is compiled inline to a specific function such as 
    Functions
        ctype() - converts a type to another type by casting
        val() - converts a string to a signed numeric value (in Microsoft.visualbasic.conversion{} namespace)
            overloaded for integers and doubles - converts chars to integers and strings to doubles
            strips $ signs etc. Reads up to first non-numeric char. Ignores spaces
            e.g. "123 45 6 abc" converst to "123456"
    Delegates
        Delegates are type-safe object-oriented references to methods 
        They can be defined and used to make methods more extensible and usable
        Delegates are reference types that point to a method signature and return type (like a java abstract method)
    Strings
    Arrays
        Arrays are declared like elementary data types with parentheses containing dimensions
            e.g. dim myInts(10) as Integer
        Multidimensional arrays are declared using comma spacing between each dimension
            e.g. dim myInts(10, 10) as Integer 
        Array values can be assigned directly
            e.g. myInts(4) = 324
        Arrays can be dimensioned and initialized in one step
            e.g. dim myInts as Integer() = New Integer(3) {1, 2, 3, 4}
        The index to an array is always a zero-based offset

Windows Registry Table of Contents (WRTOC)
    Important Precautions
        Always create a backup of the Registry before opening it with RegEdit
            Inadvertant changes to the Registry can corrupt the machine or interfer with its operation
    Additional References
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry
    Windows 2000
        Use regedt32 and not regedit to edit in 32 bit mode (at the console, type regedt32)
    History
        The registry is a central repository to replace individual application INI files
    Registry Hives
        The topmost keys in the registry are hives designated by HKEY (Hive Key)
        Hives are stored in different files or in volatile memory depending on their purpose
            e.g. %SystemRoot%\System32\Config
        Hives (Hive Keys or HKEY's) include:
            HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)  configuration for current logged on user
                A pointer to the current logged on user defined under HKEY_USERS
                The general structure of keys is:
                    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Vendor's name\Application's name\Version\Setting name
                If software cannot find the setting here, it looks in the same path in the HKLM hive
            HKEY_USERS (HKU)  configuration for all users (contains HKEY_CURRENT_USER)
                Each user is identified by a Security Identifer (SID)
                This hive is stored in a separate file per user and loaded during login
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)  configuration for the computer (any user)
                The path HKLM\SOFTWARE contains software settings on the local machine including Windows settings
                The path HKLM\HARDWARE is a dynamic file not stored on disk - it is generated in the heap space when the machine starts
            HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)  configuration for each application type/extension 
                It holds information about registered applications, such as file associations and OLE Object Class IDs
            HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC)  startup information for the computer
                This key is a handle to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\Current
                It stores runtime profile data and is refreshed at startup
         Below the HKEY entries (Keys) are a hieararchy of sub-keys
            For example: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows has 3 subkeys in its hierarchy
    Registry Entries or 'Values'
        Registry values are name/data pairs stored within a key hierarchy
        Each value in the registry contains a key and value pair
        Each value in the registry consists of three parameters:
            Value Name, Value Type (data type), Key Value
        There can be multiple registry entries within a single key hierarchy path
            Each registry entry in the same path has a unique name
    .REG Files
        .REG files are text files used for importing and exporting registry entries
        They can also be used to remove registry entries
        .REG file structure Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry
        .REG files can be started by double-clicking or
            by typing 'RegEdit.exe /s <file.reg>' on the command line with the /s option
                where /s means 'silent merge' (no prompts)
        Regedit.exe /e <file.reg> exports the registry to a file
            RegEdit.exe /e file HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT[\<key>] exports the named hive
    Group Policy Changes to Registries
        Windows Group Policies can act on multiple registries across a netowrk
        Windows will also check for Group Policy changes and apply them periodically (e.g. every 90 minutes)
        Advanced Group Policy rules can be implemented through WMI expressions
    Linux Equivalents of the Registry
        System-wide configuration files (simlar to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Windows) are in /etc/ and its subdirectorie
            User specific files are sometimes in /usr/local/etc. 
        Per-user information (similar to HKEY_CURRENT_USER) is stored in hidden directories and files
            These files a period/full stop within the user's home directory

IIS  Internet Information Server and FTP

Documentation
    http://<host ip>/iishelp/ which routes you to ...
        http://localhost/iishelp/iis/misc/default.asp

IIS Default Web Setup and Activation
    IIS includes http listener, ftp, smtp servers
    IIS documentation is physically at %systemroot%\help\iishelp (or go there through URL link)
    Install IIS using Add/Delete Programs  Windows Components and choose IIS
    IIS runs by default on port 80 of the machine  the default port for the machine
    Systemroot Directory is \inetpub\wwwroot\ and the file default.htm will execute
    Ping gjarmant-lap to get the ip address if http://gjarmant-lap does not work

Changing the Default Listener Port in IIS
    1.Open IIS Manager via Control Panel (Administrative Tools,  Internet Services Manager)
    2.Open the list of  sites under the host icon
    3.Right click the Default Web Site entry and choose Properties
    4.Choose the website tab (this is the default)
    5.Modify the TCP Port value and click OK

Starting and Stopping IIS
    At the command line, "iisreset" will stop and start the server (bounce)
        Alternatively, just start with "net start w3svc" to start IIS or check it is running

Troubleshooting IIS
    Get better error messages in the browser by turning off "friendly messages" in IExplorer
        In IE navigate "/tools/internet options/advanced/Show Friendly Http Messages" and check off
    Try stopping and starting (see above)
    The IIS runs as "inetinfo" in the task manager process list
        The executable is C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\inetinfo.exe
        It is registered as the service "World Wide Web Publishing" under Admin Tools/Services
    Check msdtc is running with "net start msdtc" - required by IIS
        If it is not installed, then do "msdtc -install"
    If .asp pages don't display there is a problem with COM object registration - try this
        cd %windir%\system32\inetsrv
        rundll32 wamreg.dll, CreateIISPackage
        regsvr32 asptxn.dll
        iisreset

FTP
    Both port 20 and port 21 must be open through the router for ftp to work
    Use ftp:// and the IP address to reach the FTP site
        Or, use ftp gjarmant-lap from the command line to connect to the server
    FTPs root directory is c:\inetpub\ftproot
    Any directories under c:\inetpub\ftproot appear as subdirectories in the browser
    Use a short name for subdirectories without spaces.

FTP Commands from the Console
    ftp (hostname) from the console to connect (have a username,password ready)
    help  ftp online help
    bin  binary mode (off by default)
    get  pull files from the remote ftp host
    put  push files to the remote host
    mget  pull multiple files from the remote ftp host
    mput  push multiple files to the remote host
    quit  quit ftp
    pwd  to show current remote directory
    dir or ls  to list files in remote directory
    ldir or lls  to list files in the local directory
    cd or lcd  change directory in the remote or local machine

SMTP
    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    -> %Systemroot%\;mail.chm

CGIs
    Common Gateway Interface
    Place executables in c:\inetpub\cgi-bin 
    Turn executable permissions on for the folder (folder properties, websharing tab, edit)
