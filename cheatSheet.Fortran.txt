g77 Fortran Cumulative Notes
    Getting Started
        In linux, create a fortran source file (soure.f) and compile it from the linux shell with with "g77 -ffree-form source.f" and it will create an executable called a.out
        Run a.out from the command line with "./a.out" or modify the path to include the current directory with PATH=$PATH:. and then simply type a.out to run it
