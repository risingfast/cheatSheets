DNS Role or Primary Function
    Resolves a domain name to an IP address

DNS Resolution Steps
    Check local host resolver cache (copies hosts file contents)
    Check local 'hosts' file at /etc/hosts (Linux) C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows) -- static file of computer names and their IP addresses
    Check DNS Resolver server (known from  /etc/resolve.conf file on local host) local internet provider address -- refers back the root server IP
    Check root server for address of TLD servers -- 13 sets of root servers worldwide - refers back the TLD server for the domain to the DNS Resolver
    Check TLD server for the domain which stores addresses for top level domain (e.g. .com, .net etc) -- refers back the Authoratative Name Server for the URL to the DNS Resolver
    Check the Authoratative Name Servers for IP address of URL - responds to local host with IP address of URL -- refers back the IP address of the URL to the DNS Resolver
    DNS Resolver stores the IP in cache and refers back to the local host
    Local host communicates with the IP address directly

DNS Record Types
    A -- maps domain name to IP4
    AAAA -- maps domain name to IP6
    CNAME -- canonical name maps subdomain to canonical name
    MX -- mail exchange
    PTR -- pointer record (reverse of A record)
    TXT -- text record for email spam rejection and domain name verification

HTTP Protocol (Application Layer Protocol)
    GET URL example: http://api.plos.org/search?q=title:DNA -- includes routing "/search" and single parameter "?q=title:DNA"
    Routing
        Static based on file path in request header start line
        Dynamic to a program that builds a response on the fly using a database query
    Request Example
        GET /orders/123 HTTP/1.1 -- start line with routing /orders/123
        Host: 127.0.0.1:80 -- destination IP and port (header line 1)
        User-Agent: Manual-Http-Request -- type of browser sending the request (header line 2)
        <empty line> -- indicates end of http request header
        <body lines> -- request body can be empty for a GET request
        POST/orders HTTP/1.1 -- start line
        Host: 127.0.0.1:80 -- destination IP and port (header line 1)
        User-Agent: Manual-Http-Request -- type of browser sending the request (header line 2)
        Content-Length: 12 -- length in bytes of content (header line 3)
        Content-Type: application/x-www... -- tells the webserver how the content is encoded (heaer line 4)
        <empty line> -- indicates end of http request header
        order_id=123 -- content body for the request
    Response
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK -- HTTP status code and meaning
        Content-Length: 88 -- chars in response body (header line 1)
        Content-Type: text/html -- type of body content for browser to handle (header line 2) other are image/jpeg and application/json
        Connection: Closed -- (header line 4)
        <empty line> -- indicates end of http response header
        <!doctype html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title>Title</title>
          </head>
            <body>
              <h1>Hello, World</h1>
            </body>
        </html>

HTTPS Protocol
    https://restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html
    https://restapitutorial.com/ -- REST tutorial
    Encrypted Tramsmission
    Requires  SSL Certificate purchased from certificate authorities like www.comodo or resellers like www.gogetssl.com (approx $6/year)
    SHA-2 Encryption protocol is needed (SHA-1 is no longer recognized as of 2014)
    Wildcard certificates are valid for all subdomains
    Certificates can be self-signed and these encrypt tranmission but throw a warning in the browser "This connection is untrusted"
    SSL uses the TLS protocol for encryption with a public (encrypt) and private (decrypt) key

    Episode 0 (Day 0) What is a Network? 10:29
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7MNX_UD7vY
    Episode 1 (Day 1) --What is a Switch
        Hubs and switches are Levels 1 & 2 in OSI
        Hub - a broadcast point for local devices with MAC addresses connected to its ports - forwards packets to all mac addresses except the source MAC address
        Switch - a switching point to any local device MAC address connected to its ports - forwards packets to a single MAC address
        Hubs and Switches are layer 2 devices
        Layer 1 -- Ethernet port - the physical level
        Layer 2 -- MAC address - data link layer address
        Layer 3 -- IP Address and Protocol
        CAM Table -- Content Addressable Memory table, maps port numbers to destination MAC addresses connected to those ports
        Switch CLI Commands -- enable
                            --   show mac-address-table
        Layer 2 content - frame
        Layer 3 content - packet
    Episode 2 -- What is a router
        Router is level 3 in OSI
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9ScLm9S3B4
        On a switch, each end-point nows the MAC and IP address mapping of other endpoint via ARP
        FFFF.FFFF.FFFF is the breadcase MAC address used by ARP to collect IP/MAC mappings from each client
        Router -- connects different networks together
        Networks are groups of IP addresses in a single range
        Routers resolve IP addresses (Layer 3)
        Router CLI Commands -- enable
                            -- show ip route
    Episode 3 -- what is TCP/IP and OSI
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRdL1PcherM 12:03
        1969 ARPANET and packet switching
        TCP/IP Model: Application, Transport, Network and Physical (Datalink and physical)
        ISO Model: Application, Presentation, Session (all in Application TCP/IP layer) Transport, Network and Physical (Datalink and Physical)a
        ISO Mnemonic: All People Seem To Need Data Processing:
        Bridges are similar to switches and operate a the datalink layer (MAC address) to subdivide large networks into subnetworks and connect then together
    Episode 4 -- REAL LIFE example!! (TCP/IP and OSI layers)
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfO61Mensg
        Layer 4 content - segment
    Episode 5 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIRkXulqJA4 -- how the OSI model works on YouTube (Application and Transport Layers)
        De-encapsulation - the process of opening and interpreting network data
        Layer 6 - Presentation Layer -- does data format (eg. HTML and PNG) and encryption (SSL)
        Layer 5 - Session Layer -- maintains a connection (eg. L2TP, RTCP, H.245, SOCKS)
        Layer 4 - Transport Layer -- TCP (reliable) or UDP (fast) includes protocol and port number
            TCP expects confirmation of message received and will resend and reconfirm if not
            Starts with a SYN, SYN ACK and ACK message to confirm a connection (the 3-Way handshake)
            Ports identify the type of transmission: http 80, https 663 ftp 21 ssh 22 Telnet 23, smptp 25RDP 3389
            Ephemeral ports are response ports assigned temporarily

            Tier 0 -- Core Layer
            Tier 1 -- Distribution Layer (aka Aggregation layer)
            Tier 2 -- Access Layer
    Episode 7 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-66D9J5PkY -- Data Center NETWORKS
        Datacenters require high network throughput between servers (VM's) in the same datacenter
        Datacenters use spine/leaf designs to connect hosts to maximize east-west traffic throughtput
        Spine/Leaf is a 2 hop design
        Leaf switches are assigned to each rack tower
        Spine switches are connected to all leaf switches
        Both Spine and Leaf switches are Layer 3 switches

    Episode 15 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WfiTHiU4x8 -- what is an IP address? // You SUCk at subnetting
        IP addresses are assigned to all devices
        Default Gateway = Router IP Address
        IP address is assigned by the router
        Every IP address has a network portion (first three octets) and a host portion (last octet)
        The subnet mask applied to any local IP address gives the network portion of the local IP address
        255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask
        192.168.1 is the normal network portion and 0 = 255 can be the host portion
        192.168.1.1 is reserved as the network address
        192.168.1.255 is reserved as the broadcast address
        192.168.1.254 is reserved as the router address (aka default gateway)
    Episode 16 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcae4TSSMo8 -- we ran OUT of IP Addresses!!
        The internet's birthday is 01 Jan 1983
        There are 4,294,967,296 possible IP addresses (2raised32) or 4.3 billion
        IP addresses are organized into classes: A, B, C, D, E
        IP addresses are controlled by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
        Class A: 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255 subnet 255.0.0.0 assigned to companies
        Loopback: 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 loopback test addresses and 127.0.0.1 is the current host loopback
        Class B: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0 subnet 255.255.0.0 (65,534 possible addresses)
        Class C: 192.0.0.0 - 233.255.255.0 subnet 255.255.255.0 (same has home networks)
        Class D: 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 no subnet mask, reserved for multicast

        Classfull network: abides by network class ranges
    Eposode 17 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bhvn9tQk8o -- we're out of IP Addresses ... but this saved us (Private IP Addresses)
        RFC 1918 in 1996 ... Private IP addresses and NAT ... reserved ranges of the public IP addresses for private use
        Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 mask 2555.0.0.0
        Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 mask 255.255.0.0
        Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 mask 255.255.255 -- common for home uses
        Private IP addresses are not unique and are not publicly routable on the internet
        Local devices get private IP addresses assigned by the router and traffic through the router gets the router IP address
        Inbound traffic is mapped back to the private IP addres by the router
        IPv4: 4 segments with three numbers per segment or 2exp32 addresses
        IPv6: 8 segments with four characters per segment alphanumeric or 2exp128 addresses
    Episode 18 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-i5x8KCfII -- i bet you can't do this (because you still suck at subnetting)
        IP addresses are 4 octets (in binary)
    Episode 19 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZGZRtaGyG8 -- What is a Subnet Mask??? (you NEED to know it!!)
        Subnet mask -- gives and controls the size of the network
                    -- the 1's show the network bits
                    -- the 0's show the subnetwork or host bits
    Episode 20 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_5qeqGOaI -- let's subnet your home network // You SUCK at subnetting
        Subnets can be created by extending the subnet mask into the host bits from left to right
        255.255.255.127 is the first subnet mask -- 2 subnets with 128 hosts in each subnet

    Day 1 Network Devices -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8W9oMNSuwo (30:20)
        Network Definition: a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources
        Network Nodes
            Switches
                Switches forward traffic within the same LAN from one device to another
                Switches cannot connect to the internet
                Examples: Cisco Catalyst 9200, Catalyst 3650
                Enterprise switches have many interfaces/ports (usually 24+)
            Routers
                Routers communicate with other routers across the internet
                Examples: Cisco ISR 1000, ISR 4000, ISR 900
                Routers have far fewer ports than switches
            Firewalls
                Definition: security features that control network traffic entering and existing a network
                Can be placed in fron of or behind a router
                Configured with security rules
                Examples: Cisco ASA5500-X and Firewpower 2100
                Next Generation Firewalls include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities
                Network firewalls filter traffic between networks
                Host-based firewalls filter traffic entering and existing a host machine like a PC
            Hosts
                Machines that can host clients or servers
            Servers
                definition: a device that provides functions or services for clients
            Clients
                definition: a device that accesses a service made available by a server
                examples: smartphone, laptop, desktop, pad, IoT device, etc aka end-points and end-hosts

    Day 2 Interfaces and Cables -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTH5lVhNaY (35:51)
        Ports are also known as Interfaces
        RJ45 (Registered Jack) ports/interfaces used on the end of copper ethernet cables
        Ethernet -- collection of network protocols and standards including physcial standards
        IEEE 803.3 1983 is the Ethernet standard
        Bit and bytes: a bit is a single value and can be one or zero. A byte is eight bits
        Speed is measured in bits per second
            10 Mbps is 100 m, 10BASE-T where BASE referest to Base band signalling, 4 wire
            100 m is 100 m, 100BASE-T, 4 wire
            1 Gbps is Gigabit Ethernet, 100 m, 1000BASE-T, 8 wire
            10 Gps is 10 Gig Ethernet, 100 m, 10GBASE-T, 8 wire
        Copper used in ethernet cables is UTP or Unshielded Twisted Pair
        Twisted pair mitigages EMI or Electromagnetic Radiation Interference
        Pins on 10BASE-T are full duplex allowing simultaneous transmission and receiving
            Between a Switch and a PC:
                1 Transmit on a switch and Receive on a PC
                2 Transmit on a switch and Receive on a PC
                3 Receive on a switch and Transmit on a PC
                6 Receive on a switch and Transmit on a PC
            Between a Router and a Switch:
                1 Transmit on a router and Receive on a switch
                2 Transmit on a router and Receive on a switch
                3 Receive on a router and Transmit on a switch
                6 Receive on a router and Transmit on a switch
            Both these cables are 'straight through' cables connecting the same pin numbers at each end
            A crossover cable reverses the PIN connections at either end
                Pin 1 ... Pin 3
                Pin 2 ... Pin 6
                Pin 3 ... Pin 1
                Pin 6 ... Pin 2
            Equipment Pin Configurations
                Router Tx 1, 2 and Rx 3, 6
                Firewall Tx 1, 2 and Rx 3, 6
                PC Tx 1, 2 and Rx 3, 6
                Switch Tx 3, 6 and Rx 1, 2
            Auto MDI-X is a new automatic logic to identify which Pins to Tx and Rx on
            1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T use 8 wires in pairs on Pins 3, 4 and 7, 8
                Pins are also bi-directional
        SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable) Transceiver connections are used by optical cables
            Fiber Optic cables have one Tx and one Rx line and they are crossed-over
            Single Mode
                Narrow core
                Laser-based transmitter
                Up to 30 km range
            Multi Mode
                Wide core allows multiple modes or angles
                Cheaper than single-mode
                LED-based transmitter
                Up to 550 m range
        Fibre-Optic Standards
            1000BASE-LX 802.3z, 1 Gbps, Multi or Single Mode, 550 m (MM), 5 km (SM

            10GBASE-ER, 802.ae, 10 Gbps, Sinle mode, 30 km
        Comparison of UTP vs Fibre-Optic
            UTP
                low cost
                Shorter distance (100 m)
                Vulnerable to EMI
                RJ45 ports are cheaper than SFP ports
                Emit or leak EMI (security risk)
            Fibre-Optic
                High cost
                Longer distance
                No EMI interference
                SFP ports are expensive (SM > MM)
                No EMI leakage

    Day 3 OSI Model & TCP/IP Suite -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ai8JzhHuY (32:51)
        Networking Protocol -- a set of logical rules defining how network devices and software should work together
        TCP/IP Suite or TCP/IP
        OSI Model -- Open Systems Interconnection Model, created by the 'Intrernational Organization for Standardization' in the late 1970's and early 80's
        For transmission, each layer down from the application encapsulates additional information to the application data
        For receiving, each layer up from the physical layer de-encapsulates the additional information from the application data
        OSI Model Layers:
            7 Application Layer (Unencapsulated)
                 Closest to the end-user
                 Interacts with user software applications
                 Examples -- HTTP and HTTPS, DHCP
                 Functions
                     Identifying communication partners
                     Synchronizing communication
            6 Presentation (Unencapsulated)
                Examples
                    Encryption
                Functions
                    Translates data between application and network formats
                    Translates between different application Layer formats
            5 Session (Unencapsulated)
                Functions
                    Controls dialogs (sessions) between communicating hosts
                    Establishes, manages and terminated connections between the local and remote applications
            4 Transport ('Segment' Layer, adds L4 header)
                Functions
                    Adds a header to the data from the Session Layer (L4 header)
                    Segments and reassembles data for communications between hosts
                        ie. breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments for reliable transmission
                    Provides host-to-host or end-to-end communication
                    Creates a series of smaller 'Segments' of L4 Headers and data from the Session Layer
                    Protocols: UDP
            3 Network ('Packet' Layer, adds L3 header)
                Functions
                    Adds a header to each segment from the transport Layer (L3 header) to create a 'Packet'
                    Provides connectivity between hosts on different networks (ie. outside of a LAN)
                    Provides logical addressing (IP addresses)
                    Provides path selection between source and destination
                Routers operate at Layer 3
            2 Data Link ('Frame' Layer, adds L2 Header and L2 Trailer)
                Functions
                    Adds a header and trailer to the packet (L2 Header and L2 Trailer)
                    Provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer (e.g. direct connection between PC to switch, switch to router, router to router)
                    Defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium (e.g. copper UTP cables)
                    Detexts and (possibly) corrects Physical Layer errors
                    Uses a separate Layer 2 addressing system from Layer 3 addressing
                Switches operate at Layer 2
            1 Physical
                Functions
                    Defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data
                    Includes: voltage levels, maximum transmission distances, physical connectors, cable specifications, etc
                    Converts bits into digital signals or encoded radio waves
            PDU's are Protocol Data Units: Data (L5, 6, 7), Segment (L4), Packet (L3), Frame (L2) and Bit (L1)
            Same-layer interaction: interaction between the same layers on different hosts
            Adjacent-layer interaction: interaction between adjacent layers on the same host
