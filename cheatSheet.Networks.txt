DNS Role or Primary Function
    Resolves a domain name to an IP address

DNS Resolution Steps
    Check local host resolver cache (copies hosts file contents)
    Check local 'hosts' file at /etc/hosts (Linux) C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows) -- static file of computer names and their IP addresses
    Check DNS Resolver server (known from  /etc/resolve.conf file on local host) local internet provider address -- refers back the root server IP
    Check root server for address of TLD servers -- 13 sets of root servers worldwide - refers back the TLD server for the domain to the DNS Resolver
    Check TLD server for the domain which stores addresses for top level domain (e.g. .com, .net etc) -- refers back the Authoratative Name Server for the URL to the DNS Resolver
    Check the Authoratative Name Servers for IP address of URL - responds to local host with IP address of URL -- refers back the IP address of the URL to the DNS Resolver
    DNS Resolver stores the IP in cache and refers back to the local host
    Local host communicates with the IP address directly

DNS Record Types
    A -- maps domain name to IP4
    AAAA -- maps domain name to IP6
    CNAME -- canonical name maps subdomain to canonical name
    MX -- mail exchange
    PTR -- pointer record (reverse of A record)
    TXT -- text record for email spam rejection and domain name verification

HTTP Protocol (Application Layer Protocol)
    GET URL example: http://api.plos.org/search?q=title:DNA -- includes routing "/search" and single parameter "?q=title:DNA"
    Routing
        Static based on file path in request header start line
        Dynamic to a program that builds a response on the fly using a database query
    Request Example
        GET /orders/123 HTTP/1.1 -- start line with routing /orders/123
        Host: 127.0.0.1:80 -- destination IP and port (header line 1)
        User-Agent: Manual-Http-Request -- type of browser sending the request (header line 2)
        <empty line> -- indicates end of http request header
        <body lines> -- request body can be empty for a GET request
        POST/orders HTTP/1.1 -- start line
        Host: 127.0.0.1:80 -- destination IP and port (header line 1)
        User-Agent: Manual-Http-Request -- type of browser sending the request (header line 2)
        Content-Length: 12 -- length in bytes of content (header line 3)
        Content-Type: application/x-www... -- tells the webserver how the content is encoded (heaer line 4)
        <empty line> -- indicates end of http request header
        order_id=123 -- content body for the request
    Response
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK -- HTTP status code and meaning
        Content-Length: 88 -- chars in response body (header line 1)
        Content-Type: text/html -- type of body content for browser to handle (header line 2) other are image/jpeg and application/json
        Connection: Closed -- (header line 4)
        <empty line> -- indicates end of http response header
        <!doctype html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title>Title</title>
          </head>
            <body>
              <h1>Hello, World</h1>
            </body>
        </html>

HTTPS Protocol
    https://restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html
    https://restapitutorial.com/ -- REST tutorial
    Encrypted Tramsmission
    Requires  SSL Certificate purchased from certificate authorities like www.comodo or resellers like www.gogetssl.com (approx $6/year)
    SHA-2 Encryption protocol is needed (SHA-1 is no longer recognized as of 2014)
    Wildcard certificates are valid for all subdomains
    Certificates can be self-signed and these encrypt tranmission but throw a warning in the browser "This connection is untrusted"
    SSL uses the TLS protocol for encryption with a public (encrypt) and private (decrypt) key

    Episode 0 (Day 0) What is a Network? 10:29
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7MNX_UD7vY
    Episode 1 (Day 1) --What is a Switch
        Hubs and switches are Levels 1 & 2 in OSI
        Hub - a broadcast point for local devices with MAC addresses connected to its ports - forwards packets to all mac addresses except the source MAC address
        Switch - a switching point to any local device MAC address connected to its ports - forwards packets to a single MAC address
        Hubs and Switches are layer 2 devices
        Layer 1 -- Ethernet port - the physical level
        Layer 2 -- MAC address - data link layer address
        Layer 3 -- IP Address and Protocol
        CAM Table -- Content Addressable Memory table, maps port numbers to destination MAC addresses connected to those ports
        Switch CLI Commands -- enable
                            --   show mac-address-table
        Layer 2 content - frame
        Layer 3 content - packet
    Episode 2 -- What is a router
        Router is level 3 in OSI
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9ScLm9S3B4
        On a switch, each end-point nows the MAC and IP address mapping of other endpoint via ARP
        FFFF.FFFF.FFFF is the breadcase MAC address used by ARP to collect IP/MAC mappings from each client
        Router -- connects different networks together
        Networks are groups of IP addresses in a single range
        Routers resolve IP addresses (Layer 3)
        Router CLI Commands -- enable
                            -- show ip route
    Episode 3 -- what is TCP/IP and OSI
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRdL1PcherM 12:03
        1969 ARPANET and packet switching
        TCP/IP Model: Application, Transport, Network and Physical (Datalink and physical)
        ISO Model: Application, Presentation, Session (all in Application TCP/IP layer) Transport, Network and Physical (Datalink and Physical)a
        ISO Mnemonic: All People Seem To Need Data Processing:
        Bridges are similar to switches and operate a the datalink layer (MAC address) to subdivide large networks into subnetworks and connect then together
    Episode 4 -- REAL LIFE example!! (TCP/IP and OSI layers)
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfO61Mensg
        Layer 4 content - segment
    Episode 5 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIRkXulqJA4 -- how the OSI model works on YouTube (Application and Transport Layers)
        De-encapsulation - the process of opening and interpreting network data
        Layer 6 - Presentation Layer -- does data format (eg. HTML and PNG) and encryption (SSL)
        Layer 5 - Session Layer -- maintains a connection (eg. L2TP, RTCP, H.245, SOCKS)
        Layer 4 - Transport Layer -- TCP (reliable) or UDP (fast) includes protocol and port number
            TCP expects confirmation of message received and will resend and reconfirm if not
            Starts with a SYN, SYN ACK and ACK message to confirm a connection (the 3-Way handshake)
            Ports identify the type of transmission: http 80, https 663 ftp 21 ssh 22 Telnet 23, smptp 25RDP 3389
            Ephemeral ports are response ports assigned temporarily
    Episode 6 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwAXlE4OtU -- DO NOT design your network like this
        Eliminate single points of failure by eliminating daisy-chains
        Add a Multilayer Switch -- a fast Layer 3 switch that can interpret IP addresses and MAC addresses
        2 Tier Network Architecture -- includes a multilayer switch in a distribution layer
            Tier 0 -- Core Layer (not implemented for 2 Layer)

            Tier 0 -- Core Layer
            Tier 1 -- Distribution Layer (aka Aggregation layer)
            Tier 2 -- Access Layer
    Episode 7 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-66D9J5PkY -- Data Center NETWORKS
        Datacenters require high network throughput between servers (VM's) in the same datacenter
        Datacenters use spine/leaf designs to connect hosts to maximize east-west traffic throughtput
        Spine/Leaf is a 2 hop design
        Leaf switches are assigned to each rack tower
        Spine switches are connected to all leaf switches
        Both Spine and Leaf switches are Layer 3 switches

    Episode 15 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WfiTHiU4x8 -- what is an IP address? // You SUCk at subnetting
        IP addresses are assigned to all devices
        Default Gateway = Router IP Address
        IP address is assigned by the router
        Every IP address has a network portion (first three octets) and a host portion (last octet)
        The subnet mask applied to any local IP address gives the network portion of the local IP address
        255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask
        192.168.1 is the normal network portion and 0 = 255 can be the host portion
        192.168.1.1 is reserved as the network address
        192.168.1.255 is reserved as the broadcast address
        192.168.1.254 is reserved as the router address (aka default gateway)

        There are 4,294,967,296 possible IP addresses (2raised32) or 4.3 billion
        IP addresses are organized into classes: A, B, C, D, E
        IP addresses are controlled by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
        Class A: 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255 subnet 255.0.0.0 assigned to companies
        Loopback: 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 loopback test addresses and 127.0.0.1 is the current host loopback
        Class B: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0 subnet 255.255.0.0 (65,534 possible addresses)
        Class C: 192.0.0.0 - 233.255.255.0 subnet 255.255.255.0 (same has home networks)
        Class D: 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255 no subnet mask, reserved for multicast
        Class E: 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 reserved for special use
        Classless network: 
        Classfull network: abides by network class ranges
    Eposode 17 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bhvn9tQk8o -- we're out of IP Addresses ... but this saved us (Private IP Addresses)
        RFC 1918 in 1996 ... Private IP addresses and NAT ... reserved ranges of the public IP addresses for private use
        Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 mask 2555.0.0.0
        Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 mask 255.255.0.0
        Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 mask 255.255.255 -- common for home uses
        Private IP addresses are not unique and are not publicly routable on the internet
        Local devices get private IP addresses assigned by the router and traffic through the router gets the router IP address
        Inbound traffic is mapped back to the private IP addres by the router
        IPv4: 4 segments with three numbers per segment or 2exp32 addresses
        IPv6: 8 segments with four characters per segment alphanumeric or 2exp128 addresses
    Episode 18 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-i5x8KCfII -- i bet you can't do this (because you still suck at subnetting)
        IP addresses are 4 octets (in binary)
    Episode 19 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZGZRtaGyG8 -- What is a Subnet Mask??? (you NEED to know it!!)
        Subnet mask -- gives and controls the size of the network
                    -- the 1's show the network bits
                    -- the 0's show the subnetwork or host bits
    Episode 20 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_5qeqGOaI -- let's subnet your home network // You SUCK at subnetting
        Subnets can be created by extending the subnet mask into the host bits from left to right
        255.255.255.127 is the first subnet mask -- 2 subnets with 128 hosts in each subnet

    Day 01 Network Devices -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8W9oMNSuwo (30:26)
        Network Definition: a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources
        Network Nodes
            Switches
                Switches forward traffic within the same LAN from one device to another
                Switches cannot connect to the internet
                Examples: Cisco Catalyst 9200, Catalyst 3650
                Enterprise switches have many interfaces/ports (usually 24+)
            Routers
                Routers communicate with other routers across the internet
                Examples: Cisco ISR 1000, ISR 4000, ISR 900
                Routers have far fewer ports than switches
            Firewalls
                Definition: security features that control network traffic entering and existing a network
                Can be placed in fron of or behind a router
                Configured with security rules
                Examples: Cisco ASA5500-X and Firewpower 2100
                Next Generation Firewalls include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities
                Network firewalls filter traffic between networks
                Host-based firewalls filter traffic entering and existing a host machine like a PC
            Hosts
                Machines that can host clients or servers
            Servers
                definition: a device that provides functions or services for clients
            Clients
                definition: a device that accesses a service made available by a server
                examples: smartphone, laptop, desktop, pad, IoT device, etc aka end-points and end-hosts

    Day 02 Interfaces and Cables -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTH5lVhNaY (35:51)
        Ports are also known as Interfaces
        RJ45 (Registered Jack) ports/interfaces used on the end of copper ethernet cables
        Ethernet -- collection of network protocols and standards including physcial standards
        IEEE 803.3 1983 is the Ethernet standard
        Bit and bytes: a bit is a single value and can be one or zero. A byte is eight bits
        Speed is measured in bits per second
            10 Mbps is 100 m, 10BASE-T where BASE referest to Base band signalling, 4 wire
            100 m is 100 m, 100BASE-T, 4 wire
            1 Gbps is Gigabit Ethernet, 100 m, 1000BASE-T, 8 wire
            10 Gps is 10 Gig Ethernet, 100 m, 10GBASE-T, 8 wire
        Copper used in ethernet cables is UTP or Unshielded Twisted Pair
        Twisted pair mitigages EMI or Electromagnetic Radiation Interference
        Pins on 10BASE-T are full duplex allowing simultaneous transmission and receiving
            Between a Switch and a PC:
                1 Transmit on a switch and Receive on a PC
                2 Transmit on a switch and Receive on a PC
                3 Receive on a switch and Transmit on a PC
                6 Receive on a switch and Transmit on a PC
            Between a Router and a Switch:
                1 Transmit on a router and Receive on a switch
                2 Transmit on a router and Receive on a switch
                3 Receive on a router and Transmit on a switch
                6 Receive on a router and Transmit on a switch
            Both these cables are 'straight through' cables connecting the same pin numbers at each end
            A crossover cable reverses the PIN connections at either end
                Pin 1 ... Pin 3
                Pin 2 ... Pin 6
                Pin 3 ... Pin 1
                Pin 6 ... Pin 2
            Equipment Pin Configurations
                Router Tx 1, 2 and Rx 3, 6
                Firewall Tx 1, 2 and Rx 3, 6
                PC Tx 1, 2 and Rx 3, 6
                Switch Tx 3, 6 and Rx 1, 2
            Auto MDI-X is a new automatic logic to identify which Pins to Tx and Rx on
            1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T use 8 wires in pairs on Pins 3, 4 and 7, 8
                Pins are also bi-directional
        SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable) Transceiver connections are used by optical cables
            Fiber Optic cables have one Tx and one Rx line and they are crossed-over
            Single Mode
                Narrow core
                Laser-based transmitter
                Up to 30 km range
            Multi Mode
                Wide core allows multiple modes or angles
                Cheaper than single-mode
                LED-based transmitter
                Up to 550 m range
        Fibre-Optic Standards
            1000BASE-LX 802.3z, 1 Gbps, Multi or Single Mode, 550 m (MM), 5 km (SM
            10GBASE-SR, 802.qe, 10 Gbps,  Multimode, 400 m
            10GBASE-LR, 802.ae, 10 Gbps, Single mode, 10 km
            10GBASE-ER, 802.ae, 10 Gbps, Sinle mode, 30 km
        Comparison of UTP vs Fibre-Optic
            UTP
                low cost
                Shorter distance (100 m)
                Vulnerable to EMI
                RJ45 ports are cheaper than SFP ports
                Emit or leak EMI (security risk)
            Fibre-Optic
                High cost
                Longer distance
                No EMI interference
                SFP ports are expensive (SM > MM)
                No EMI leakage

    Day 03 OSI Model & TCP/IP Suite -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ai8JzhHuY (32:51)
        Networking Protocol -- a set of logical rules defining how network devices and software should work together
        TCP/IP Suite or TCP/IP
        OSI Model -- Open Systems Interconnection Model, created by the 'Intrernational Organization for Standardization' in the late 1970's and early 80's
        For transmission, each layer down from the application encapsulates additional information to the application data
        For receiving, each layer up from the physical layer de-encapsulates the additional information from the application data
        OSI Model Layers:
            7 Application Layer (Unencapsulated)
                 Closest to the end-user
                 Interacts with user software applications
                 Examples -- HTTP and HTTPS, DHCP
                 Functions
                     Identifying communication partners
                     Synchronizing communication
            6 Presentation (Unencapsulated)
                Examples
                    Encryption
                Functions
                    Translates data between application and network formats
                    Translates between different application Layer formats
            5 Session (Unencapsulated)
                Functions
                    Controls dialogs (sessions) between communicating hosts
                    Establishes, manages and terminated connections between the local and remote applications
            4 Transport ('Segment' Layer, adds L4 header)
                Functions
                    Adds a header to the data from the Session Layer (L4 header)
                    Segments and reassembles data for communications between hosts
                        ie. breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments for reliable transmission
                    Provides host-to-host or end-to-end communication
                    Creates a series of smaller 'Segments' of L4 Headers and data from the Session Layer
                    Protocols: UDP
            3 Network ('Packet' Layer, adds L3 header)
                Functions
                    Adds a header to each segment from the transport Layer (L3 header) to create a 'Packet'
                    Provides connectivity between hosts on different networks (ie. outside of a LAN)
                    Provides logical addressing (IP addresses)
                    Provides path selection between source and destination
                Routers operate at Layer 3
            2 Data Link ('Frame' Layer, adds L2 Header and L2 Trailer)
                Functions
                    Adds a header and trailer to the packet (L2 Header and L2 Trailer)
                    Provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer (e.g. direct connection between PC to switch, switch to router, router to router)
                    Defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium (e.g. copper UTP cables)
                    Detexts and (possibly) corrects Physical Layer errors
                    Uses a separate Layer 2 addressing system from Layer 3 addressing
                Switches operate at Layer 2
            1 Physical
                Functions
                    Defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data
                    Includes: voltage levels, maximum transmission distances, physical connectors, cable specifications, etc
                    Converts bits into digital signals or encoded radio waves
            PDU's are Protocol Data Units: Data (L5, 6, 7), Segment (L4), Packet (L3), Frame (L2) and Bit (L1)
            Same-layer interaction: interaction between the same layers on different hosts
            Adjacent-layer interaction: interaction between adjacent layers on the same host

        Cisco IOS -- Cisco Internetwork Operating System
        CLI vs GUI -- Cisco support both interfaces but CLI is most often used
        A laptop can be connected to the console port on a Cisco device: RJ45 or USB Mini-B
        RJ45 connector uses RJ45 Rollover cable: RJ45 to Serial connection
        Putty can be used once the connection is made, by choosing the 'Serial' connection

    Day 05 Ethernet LAN Switching (Part 1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2n762WG0Vo (38:13)
        Switches operate at Layer 2 Data Link
        A LAN is  network in a small area like a home or office
        Routers connect different LANs
        One LAN can have multiple switches
        The PDU for a LAN is a 'Frame'
        Frame Header (5 fields, 22 bytes)
            Preamble -- 7 bytes (56 bits) long 10101010 repeated 7 times, allows devices ot synchronize their receiver clocks
            SFD -- Start Frame Delimiter, 1 byte, 10101011, indicates the end of the preamble and beginning of the rest of the frame
            Destination -- Layer 2 frame destination device address, MAC address, 6 bytes (48 bits)
            Source -- Layer 2 device that send the frame, MCA address, 6 buytes (48 bits)
            Type (or length) -- the Layer 3 protocol of the encapsulated packet (almost always IPv4 or IPv6), 2 bytes (16 bits), length if < 1500, > 1536 indicates type
                 0x0800 (hex) 2048 (dec) IPv4
                 0x86DD (hex) 34525 (dec) IPv6
        Frame Trailer (4 bytes)
            FCS -- Frame Check Sequence, used by the receiving device to detect transmisson errors in the frame
                4 bytes (32 bits) supports CRC algorithm
        MAC Address (Media Access Control) -- 6 byte address (48 bits) assigned when a device is manufactured
        BIA Burned In Address (aka MAC addess)
        Globally unique
        Comprises:
            OUI -- Organizationally Unique Identifier, 3 bytes
            Device identifier -- unique to the device, 3 bytes
            Example: E8BA.7011.2874, DA80.832E.7E75
        Unicast Frame: a frame destined for a single target with a single destination MAC address
        Dynamic MAC Addess -- Dynamically learned MAC address, a MAC address assigned to a receiving port number on a switch and saved on a MAC address table
        Unknown Unicast Frame -- a frame where the destination MAC address is not on the MAC address table
        Flooding -- a broadcast by the switch to all ports/interfaces to learn a missing MAC address
            The frame is sent to all interfaces except the interface it was received on
            All devices with non-matching MAC addresses ignore the Flood
            The correct MAC address port/interface is learned when the matching MAC device responds
        Known Unicast Frame -- a frame where the destination MCA addres is on the MAC address table
        MAC addresses are removed from the MAC address table after a pre-defined period (5 mins for Cisco) Aging
    Day 06 Ethernet LAN Switching (Part 2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q1pqdmdPjo (33:41)
        Ethernet Frame Header (segments considered part of the header) (14 bytes)
            Destination (6 bytes)
            Source (6 bytes)
            Type (2 bytes)
        Ethernet Frame Trailer
            FCS (4 bytes(
        Minimum Size of an Ethernet Frame is 64 bytes (excluding the preamble and SFD)
        Minimu payload = 46 bytes (64 - 14 - 4)
        Padding is added to reach the minimum using bit 0's
        ARP -- Address Resolution Address, used to discover the Level 2 address for a known Level 3 address
            ARP Request -- sent as a broadcast frame, includes FFFF.FFFF.FFFF destination MAC address
            ARP Reply -- a unicast response to the requesting host
        ARP Table -- stores MAC and IP address mappings
        arp -a -- show the local ARP table (Windows, Mac, Linux)

    Day 09 Switch Interfaces https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCqluocfQe0 (32:17)
        Speed -- bits per second
            a-100 -- 100 mbps auto-negotiated
            100 -- 100 mbps set manually
            auto -- capable of negotiating with a device when connected to set speed
        Duplex -- ability to receive and send simultaneously
            full -- capable and set manualy
            a-full -- capable and auto-negotiated
            half - not capable
            auto - capable of negotiating with a device when connected to set duplex
        Half duplex is not broadly used anymore.
        Switch interfaces are in the up/up state by default for level 1 and level 2 if they are connected to another device
        Switch interfaces are in the down/down state by default for level 1 and level 2 if they are not physically connected to another device
        #show interfaces status
        #speed -- set the speed manually
        #duplex -- set the duplex value manually
        interface status can be set in ranges
        #interface range f0/5 - 12 followed by the appliable command
            #description ## not in use ##
            #shutdown
        #interface range f05 - 6, f0/9 - 12 -- to set the status on non-continuous ranges in one command
        CSMA/CD -- Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
            used by hubs which operate half duplex
        Switches operate at full duplex
        Speed/Duplex Autonegotiation
            Interfaces 'advertise' their capabilities and negotiate a common speed and duplex setting with a connected device
            E - 10
            F - 10/100
            G - 10/100/1000
            Autonegotiation may be disabled on a device
                A switch will use the lowest speed by default
                A switch will use half duplex if the speed is set to 10/100
                A switch will use full duplex if the speed is set to 1000 or greater
        #show interfaces -- in the CLI to see error counts
            runts -- frames smaller than 64 bytes (Ethernet min)
            giants -- frames larger than 1518 bytes (Ethernet max)
            CRC -- frames failing the CRC check in the FCS segment
            frame -- counter of frames with invalid format
    Day 10 IPv4 Header https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQB22y4liXA (30:10)
        IPv4 -- Internet Protocol version 4 is a layer 3 protocol
        It routes data between devices on separate networks (aka routing)
        Layer 3 PDU is a packet containing an L4 and L3 header
        Header Fields
            Version -- 4 bits 4 (0100) or 6 (0110)
            IHL -- Internet Header Length, 4 bits, in 4-byte increments, min 5 (or 20 bytes, so Options field is empty), max 15 (60 bytes)
            DSCP -- Differentiated Services Code Point, 6 bits, used for QoS or Quality of Service
            ECN -- Explicit Congestion Notification, 2 bits, identifies a congested line between two end-points
            Total Length -- 16 bits, gives the length of the packet (L3 header and L4 segment) in bytes, min 20 bytes, max 65,535 bytes
            Identification -- 16 bits, on fragments to identify the related packet
            Flags -- 3 bits, Bit 0: reserved and 0, Bit 1: Don't Fragment (DF bit), used to indicate if a packet should not be fragmented, Bit 2: More Fragments bit (set to 1 if there are more fragments, otherwise 0)
            Fragment Offset -- 13 bits, indicates the position of this fragment within the packet of fragments
            Time to Live or TTL -- 8 bits, a router will drop a packet with TTL 0, used to prevent infinite loops, a hop count (default 64, max 255) and decremented by each router in the packet voyage
            Protocol -- protocol of the encapsulated L4PDU: TCP is 6, UDP is 17, ICMP is 1, OSPF is 89
            Header CheckSum -- a calculated checksum of the IPv4 header
            Source IP Address -- 32 bits, the sender of the packet
            Destination IP Address -- 32 bits, the intended receiver
            Options -- 0 to 320 bits, frequently empty
    Day 11 (Part 1) Routing Fundamentals https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHwAm8GYbn8 (30:59)
            Routing is the identification of a path IP packets take over a network to reach a destination
            Routers store routes to known destinations in a routing table
            Routing methods: 
                Dynamic Routing: using OSPF to share routing information and automatically build routing tables
                Static Routing: done manually
                A route identifies the next hop (router) address for a final address
                A route identifies the destination if the node is connected directly to the router
                A route may be the router IP itself, which is not forwarded
            #show ip route -- show the routing table on a router
                One connnected and one local route is configured when a port is assigned an IP address
                A connected route is a route to the network the interface is connected to: eg. 192.168.1.1/24 and provides a route to all hosts in that network
                A local route is a route to the exact IP address configured on the interface: eg. 192.168.1.1/32
                A router will choose the most specific matching route which is the route with the longest prefix length (or netmask length)
            Routers do not flood packets with no matchig route. The packet is dropped if a matching route cannot be found
    Day 11 (Part 2) Static Routing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCv4-_sMvYE (37:43)
        Static routes are manually configured
        Default Gateway (aka Router) is the address where packets are sent if they are destined outside the LAN
        The Default Route is the address of the Default Gateway (aka Router) and is 0.0.0.0/0 and is the least specific route
        #ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.13.3 -- define a static route final destination and next hop
        Static routes are configured with two-way reachability with forward and reverse routes configured
        Exit interface routing specifies the port or interface name to foreward packets
            #ip rout 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 g0/0 -- specify the next hop interface
            #ip rout 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 g0/1 192.168.24.4 -- specify the next hop IP and interface
        A default route is a route to 0.0.0.0/0 and includes every possible IP address
        A default rout is often used to direct traffic to the internet
        #show ip route -> "Gateway of last resort is not set" in the CLI means no default gateway route had been set
        #ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2 -- configures the default route and the netmask must be specified as 0.0.0.0

    Day 13 Subnetting (Part 1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ8sdpGQu8c (28:54)
        Subnetting class C networks
        CIFR -- Classless Inter-Domain Routing
        IANA -- Internet Assigned Numbers Authority -- assignes networks to companies based on their size
        the IETF -- Internet Engineering Task Force introduced CIDR in 1993 to replace 'classful' addressing (i.e. classes A - E)
        The /8, /16 and /24 requirements of Classful networking were removed to allow for subnets
        /31 masks allow 2 host addresses which can only be used for point to point routes
        /32 masks only allow one address which is the network address
        CIDR notation is /XX trailing the IP network address

        FLSM -- Fixed Lengt Subnet Masks
        VLSM Variable Length Subnet Masks
        VLSM creates subnets of different sizes within a network
        VLSM Steps
            1. Assign the largest subnet at the start of the address space
            2. Assign the second largest after that
            3. Repeat until all subnets are assigned

    Day 16 VLANs (Part 1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjFzOnm6u1g
        VLAN -- Virtual Local Area Networks
        A LAN is a single broadcast domain which receives a broadcast frame (MAC FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.FFFF) sent by any member
        VLANs are configured on a switch to limit broadcast frames to specific ports and prevent flooding across subnetted LAN's
        A switch will not forward traffic between VLANs, including broadcase/unknown unicast traffic
        A switch will not route traffic between hosts in different VLANs. The traffic must go through a router
        VLANs are configured on switches on a per-interface basis
        VLANs logically separate end-hosts at Layer 2
        #show vlan brief -- to show VLAN's on a switch CLI
        VLANs 1 and 1002, 1003, 1004 and 1005 are configured by default and cannot be deleted
        An access port is a switchport belonging to a single VLAN
        A trunk port is a port assigned to more than one VLAN
        #interface range g1/0 - 3 -- edit interfaces in a range
        #switchport mode access -- set the curent range of interfaces as access ports
        #switchport access vlan 10 -- assign the access ports to a vlan
        #vlan 10 -- to edit the settings in vlan10
        #name ENGINEERING -- rename the current vlan

    Day 17 VLANs (Part 2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl9OOzNaBDU (40:48)a
        Trunk Ports -- use VLAN tagging to identify traffic for each VLAN sharing a trunk interface
        Trunk ports are also known as tagged ports due to tagging
        Access pprts are untagged ports
        Trunking Protocols
            ISL (Inter-Switch Link) -- an older CISCO protocol
            IEEE 802.1Q. or dot1q -- a newer IEEE industry standard protocol
        802.1Q Encapsulation -- inserts a 4 byte tag between the Source and Type/Length fields in a frame (ethernet header)
            TPID Tag -- Protocol Identifier 16 bits 0x8100
            TCI -- Tag Control Information: 3 subfields: PCP (3 bit), DEI (1 bit) and VID (12 bits)
               PCP -- Priority Code POint indicate Cos (Class of Service) in congested networks
               DEI -- Drop Eligible Indicator indicates if the frame can be dropped in a congested network
               VID -- VLAN ID identifies the VLAN that the frame belongs to and allows 2^12 or 4096 VLANS, 1 - 1094 allowed
        Normal VLAN's (VID range 1 - 1005)
        Extended VLAN's (VID range 1--6 - 4094) -- not supported by older switches
        The Native VLAN is 1 by default and an 802.1q tag is not added for native VLAN traffic
        ROAS -- Router on a Stick -- is like a trunk port or a router
        VNA Configuration via CLI
        #nterface g0/0 -- to enter interface configuration
        #switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q == set the trunk interface encapsulation protocol
        #switchport mode trunk -- to set the interface as trunk
        #show interfaces trunk -- to show the status of trunk interfaces
        #switchport trunk allowed vlan 10, 30 -- set the allowed VLAN's on a new trunk port and exclude other VLANs
        #switchport trunk allowed vlan add 20 -- add another vlan to an existing trunk
        #switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 20 -- removes vlan20 from a trunk port
        #switchport trunk allowed vlan all -- allow all vlans on the trunk port
        #switchport trunk allowed vlan except 1-5,20 -- allow all except the listed VLANs on a trunk port
        #switchport trunk allowed vlan none -- blocks all VLAN traffic on a trunk port
        #switchport trunk native vlan 1001 -- assign the native vlan to an unused VLAN number

    Day 18 VLANs (Part 3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkPB028l2eE (32:31)
        Layer 3 Switch or Multi-Layer Switch
            Capable of switching and routing
            Layer 3 aware
            You can create virtual interfaces for each VLAN and assign IP addresses to those interfaces
            You can configure routes on the switch, just like a router
            It can be used for inter-VLAN routing
        SVI - Switch Virtual Interfaces are virtual interfaces you can assign IP addresses to, in a multi-layer switch
        Configure each PC to use the SVI (and not the router) as their gateway address

    Day 19 DTP and VTP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtQV_0Sjszg (37:34)
        DTP -- Dynamic Trunking Protocol, Cisco proprietary protocol which allows switches to negotiate the status of their switchports to be access or trunk, without manual configurationa
        #switchport mode dynamic ? -- auto or desirable
        VTP -- Virtual Trunking Protocol, Cisco proprietary protocol which allows VLAN configuration on a central switch to act as a server for other switches to synchronize toa
    Day 19 DTP and VTP (Lab) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngTns2vF_44
    Day 20 STP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-bK-EFt9cY (38:39)
        STP -- Spanning Tree Protocol
        RST -- Rapid Spanning Tree is an updated version of STP
        Redundancy in Networks is an essential part of network design, to avoid downtime
        Most PC's have only one interface and can only be plugged into a single switch
        Important servers have multiple NIC's so thay can be plugged into multiple switches for redundance
        Spanning Tree enables network redundancy
        Broadcast Storms -- are caused by redundant switch ports rebroadcasting frames indefinitely with no TTL limit at Layer 2
        MAC Address Flapping -- continuous updating of the MAC address table on a switch due to a frame with the same MAC address arriving on a different switch interface
        Spanning Tree is a Layer 2 protocol that resolves broadcast storms and MAC address Flapping on redundant networks
        Classic STP is IEEE 802.1D
        Switches from all vendors run STP by default and it does not need to be enabled explicitly
        STP places redundant ports in blocking state, essentially disabling the interface
        These blocked interfaces act as backup which can enter a forwarding state if an active intterface fails
    Day 20 STP (Lab) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev9gy7B5hx0
    Day 30 TCP & UDP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIEACBqlntY
        Layer 4 Protocols -- Transport Layer, provides transparent transfer of data between hosts
            Provides transparent transer of data 'segments' between hosts
            Provides services to applications (TCP only, not used by UDP)
               reliable data transfer (i.e. all data received)
               error recovery (resend corrupted data)
               data sequencing to reorder data received out of sequence
               flow control to make sure the data source does not overrun the destination with too much data at once
            Provides ports (Layer 4 addressing)
            Identify Application Layer protocol
            Provides session multiplexing
        The destination port identifies the Application Layer Protocol (e.g. Port 80 is HTTP)
        The source port identifies the sessio on the client machine for routing responses from the server
        A client will use multple different source ports for sessions with one or more servers
        Port numbers are managed by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Agency)
            0 - 1023 system or 'Well-known' port numbers
            1024 - 49151 User or Registered port numbers
            49152 - 65535 Ephemeral ports (aka private or dynamic ports) -- used as source port numbers to identify sessions with servers
        TCP -- Transmission Control Protocol
        UDP -- User Datagram Protocol -- a simpler protocol than TCP
        TCP is a connection-oriented protocol -- before sending data, a connection is established between the hosts
        TCP provides reliable communication -- the TCP host must acknowledge that it received each TCP segment -- if no acknowledgement is received the packet is resent
        TCP provides sequencing -- the sequence number in the TCP header allows the destination host to order packets received out of order
        TCP provides flow control -- the destination host can tell the source to increase or decrease the rate that data is sent
        TCP header -- 24 bytes
            Source Port -- 2 bytes, 2^16 or 65,536 bits
            Destination Port -- 2 bytes or 65,536 bits
            Sequence No -- 2 bytes or 4,294,967,296 bits
            Acknowledgement No -- 4 bytes or  2,294,967,296 bits
            ACK flag -- 1 bit -- Acknowledgement
            SYN flag -- 1 bit -- Synchronization
            FIN flag -- 1 bit -- Finish ore terminate connection
            Window Size -- 2 bytes (65,536 bits) -- used for flow control and adjusting the rate of transmission
        TCP Handshake to connect: 3-Way Handshake' -- SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK
        TCP Handshake to terminate: 4-Way Handshake -- FIN, ACK, FIN, ACK
        UDP is not connection oriented
        UDP does not provide reliable communication -- acknowledgements are not sent
        UDP does not provide sequencing
        UDP does not provide flow control
        UDP Header -- 8 bytes
            Source Port -- 2 bytes
            Destination Port -- 2 bytes
            Length - 2 bytes
            checksum -- 2 bytes
        TCP vs UDP
            TCP provides more features and entails greater overhead
            TCP is preferred for reliable communications
            UDP is preferred for real-time voice and video
            TFTP is an application that uses UDP but has reliability built into the application
            Some applications use both protocols: DNS is an example

            TCP: FTP data (20), FTP control (21), SSH (22), Telnet (23), SMTP (25), HTTP (80), POP3 (110), HTTPS (443)
            UDP: DHCP server (67), DHCP client (68), TFTP (69), SNMP agent (161), SNMP manager (162), Syslog (514)

    Day 31 IPv6 Part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNuXyOXae5U (39:26)
        IPv5 is version 5 taken by the Internet Stream Protocol from the late 1970's
        The successor to IPv4 was named IPv6 to avoid confusion with the never-implemented IPv5
        Version = 4 in the Layer 3 packet header indicates IPv4 and Verson = 6 indicates IPv6
        0b -- binary prefix
        0d -- decimal prefix
        0x -- hexadecimal prefix
        IPv6 is needed to address running out if IP addresses with IPv4 which as 2^32 addresses
        IPv4 addresses are controlled by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
        IANA distribute IPv4 address space to various RIR's (Regional Internet Registries) which assign them to companies as needed
        RIR's are 
            ARFINIC -- Africa
            APNIC -- Asia Pacific and Australia
            ARIN -- US and Canada
            LACNIC -- Latin America and Mexico
            RIPE NCC -- Europe, Russia and the Middle East
            IPv6 is 128 bits which is 4 times the length of IPv4 which is 32 bits
            IPv6 are written in hexadecimal and not dotted decimal like IPv4
            IPv6 are written /64 dividing the address into equal parts for network and host portions
            IPv6 address shortening includes:
                remove leading zeroes from each quartet
                relace consecutive quartets of all zeros with '::' but only once in any address
                remove leading zeroes in all zero quartets
        #ipv6 unicast-routing -- allows the router to perform IPv6 routing
        #int g0/0 -- select the g0/0 interface/port for configuration
        #ipv5 address 2001:db8:0:0::1/64 -- assign an IPv6 addess to the interface/port
        #no shutdown -- to enable the interface/port
        #show ipv6 interface brief

    Day 38 DNS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C6eeQes4cs (30:11)
        DNS -- Domain Name System
        Converts domain names to IP addresses
        Hosts do not use domain names ... they use IP addresses
        DNS servers are queried for mappings and DNS servers can be manually configured or learned via DHCP
        USe nslookup <domain name> to get an IP address manually
        DNS 'A' records are IPv4
        DNS 'AAAA' records are IPv6
        DNS queries use UDP, except for messages over 512 bytes which use TCP
        Port 53 is the destination port for nsLookup
        A local DNS cache stores DNS maps as they are learned. Display using ipconfig /displaynds
        DNS CNAME records are Canonical Names -- a DNS record type that maps a name to another name
        ipconfig /all -- windows to display network settings
        ipconfig /displaydns -- display the localhost DNS cache
        ipconfig /flushdns -- clears the local DNS cache
        c:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts -- local file of host names and IP addresses -- an alternative to DNS which preceded DNS
        A router can be configured as a DNS client
        #ip dns server -- configures a router as a DNS server
        #ip host <hostname> <ip address> -- to add a DNS entry
        #ip name-server 8.8.8.8 -- configures an external DNS server to handle all hostnames not in the local list
        #ip domain lookup -- enabled by default but enables an external name server
        #show hosts -- lists all the learned and configured DNS entries
        #ip domain name <domain name> -- configures the default doman name on a Cisco router acting as a DNS server
