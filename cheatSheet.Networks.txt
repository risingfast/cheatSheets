DNS Role or Primary Function
    Resolves a domain name to an IP address

DNS Resolution Steps
    Check local host resolver cache (copies hosts file contents)
    Check local 'hosts' file at /etc/hosts (Linux) C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts (Windows) -- static file of computer names and their IP addresses
    Check DNS Resolver server (known from  /etc/resolve.conf file on local host) local internet provider address -- refers back the root server IP
    Check root server for address of TLD servers -- 13 sets of root servers worldwide - refers back the TLD server for the domain to the DNS Resolver
    Check TLD server for the domain which stores addresses for top level domain (e.g. .com, .net etc) -- refers back the Authoratative Name Server for the URL to the DNS Resolver
    Check the Authoratative Name Servers for IP address of URL - responds to local host with IP address of URL -- refers back the IP address of the URL to the DNS Resolver
    DNS Resolver stores the IP in cache and refers back to the local host
    Local host communicates with the IP address directly

DNS Record Types
    A -- maps domain name to IP4
    AAAA -- maps domain name to IP6
    CNAME -- canonical name maps subdomain to canonical name
    MX -- mail exchange
    PTR -- pointer record (reverse of A record)
    TXT -- text record for email spam rejection and domain name verification

Linux Utilities
    dig
    ifconfig
    nslookup
    ping

HTTP Protocol (Application Layer Protocol)
    GET URL example: http://api.plos.org/search?q=title:DNA -- includes routing "/search" and single parameter "?q=title:DNA"
    Routing
        Static based on file path in request header start line
        Dynamic to a program that builds a response on the fly using a database query
    Request Example
        GET /orders/123 HTTP/1.1 -- start line with routing /orders/123
        Host: 127.0.0.1:80 -- destination IP and port (header line 1)
        User-Agent: Manual-Http-Request -- type of browser sending the request (header line 2)
        <empty line> -- indicates end of http request header
        <body lines> -- request body can be empty for a GET request
        POST/orders HTTP/1.1 -- start line
        Host: 127.0.0.1:80 -- destination IP and port (header line 1)
        User-Agent: Manual-Http-Request -- type of browser sending the request (header line 2)
        Content-Length: 12 -- length in bytes of content (header line 3)
        Content-Type: application/x-www... -- tells the webserver how the content is encoded (heaer line 4)
        <empty line> -- indicates end of http request header
        order_id=123 -- content body for the request
    Response
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK -- HTTP status code and meaning
        Content-Length: 88 -- chars in response body (header line 1)
        Content-Type: text/html -- type of body content for browser to handle (header line 2) other are image/jpeg and application/json
        Connection: Closed -- (header line 4)
        <empty line> -- indicates end of http response header
        <!doctype html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title>Title</title>
          </head>
            <body>
              <h1>Hello, World</h1>
            </body>
        </html>

HTTPS Protocol
    https://restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html
    https://restapitutorial.com/ -- REST tutorial
    Encrypted Tramsmission
    Requires  SSL Certificate purchased from certificate authorities like www.comodo or resellers like www.gogetssl.com (approx $6/year)
    SHA-2 Encryption protocol is needed (SHA-1 is no longer recognized as of 2014)
    Wildcard certificates are valid for all subdomains
    Certificates can be self-signed and these encrypt tranmission but throw a warning in the browser "This connection is untrusted"
    SSL uses the TLS protocol for encryption with a public (encrypt) and private (decrypt) key

    Episode 0 (Day 0) What is a Network? 10:29
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7MNX_UD7vY
    Episode 1 (Day 1) --What is a Switch
        Hubs and switches are Levels 1 & 2 in OSI
        Hub - a broadcast point for local devices with MAC addresses connected to its ports - forwards packets to all mac addresses except the source MAC address
        Switch - a switching point to any local device MAC address connected to its ports - forwards packets to a single MAC address
        Hubs and Switches are layer 2 devices
        Layer 1 -- Ethernet port - the physical level
        Layer 2 -- MAC address - data link layer address
        Layer 3 -- IP Address and Protocol
        CAM Table -- Content Addressable Memory table, maps port numbers to destination MAC addresses connected to those ports
        Switch CLI Commands -- enable
                            --   show mac-address-table
        Layer 2 content - frame
        Layer 3 content - packet
    Episode 2 -- What is a router
        Router is level 3 in OSI
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9ScLm9S3B4
        On a switch, each end-point nows the MAC and IP address mapping of other endpoint via ARP
        FFFF.FFFF.FFFF is the breadcase MAC address used by ARP to collect IP/MAC mappings from each client
        Router -- connects different networks together
        Networks are groups of IP addresses in a single range
        Routers resolve IP addresses (Layer 3)
        Router CLI Commands -- enable
                            -- show ip route
    Episode 3 -- what is TCP/IP and OSI
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRdL1PcherM 12:03
        1969 ARPANET and packet switching
        TCP/IP Model: Application, Transport, Network and Physical (Datalink and physical)
        ISO Model: Application, Presentation, Session (all in Application TCP/IP layer) Transport, Network and Physical (Datalink and Physical)a
        ISO Mnemonic: All People Seem To Need Data Processing:
        Bridges are similar to switches and operate a the datalink layer (MAC address) to subdivide large networks into subnetworks and connect then together
    Episode 4 -- REAL LIFE example!! (TCP/IP and OSI layers)
        Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfO61Mensg
        Layer 4 content - segment
    Episode 5 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIRkXulqJA4 -- how the OSI model works on YouTube (Application and Transport Layers)
        De-encapsulation - the process of opening and interpreting network data
        Layer 6 - Presentation Layer -- does data format (eg. HTML and PNG) and encryption (SSL)
        Layer 5 - Session Layer -- maintains a connection (eg. L2TP, RTCP, H.245, SOCKS)
        Layer 4 - Transport Layer -- TCP (reliable) or UDP (fast) includes protocol and port number
            TCP expects confirmation of message received and will resend and reconfirm if not
            Starts with a SYN, SYN ACK and ACK message to confirm a connection (the 3-Way handshake)
            Ports identify the type of transmission: http 80, https 663 ftp 21 ssh 22 Telnet 23, smptp 25RDP 3389
            Ephemeral ports are response ports assigned temporarily
    Episode 6 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwAXlE4OtU -- DO NOT design your network like this
        Eliminate single points of failure by eliminating daisy-chains
        Add a Multilayer Switch -- a fast Layer 3 switch that can interpret IP addresses and MAC addresses
        2 Tier Network Architecture -- includes a multilayer switch in a distribution layer
            Tier 0 -- Core Layer (not implemented for 2 Layer)
            Tier 1 -- Collapsed Core Layer (Distribution Layer and Core Layer combined)
            Tier 2 -- Access Layer
        3 Tier Network Architecture -- includes a multilayer switch in a distribution layer
            Tier 0 -- Core Layer
            Tier 1 -- Distribution Layer (aka Aggregation layer)
            Tier 2 -- Access Layer
    Episode 7 -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-66D9J5PkY -- Data Center NETWORKS
        Datacenters require high network throughput between servers (VM's) in the same datacenter
        Datacenters use spine/leaf designs to connect hosts to maximize east-west traffic throughtput
        Spine/Leaf is a 2 hop design
        Leaf switches are assigned to each rack tower
        Spine switches are connected to all leaf switches
        Both Spine and Leaf switches are Layer 3 switches
