    To fix missing main menus after responsibility adds/changes, run (in System Administrator):
        End-date then un-end-date the user in System Administrator Security, then run the following:
        Sync responsibility role data into the WF table
            See: During Login Responsibilities Assigned to Users do not Appear in the Navigator Page [ID 565130.1]
            See: Unable to See Responsibilities after End Date Is Removed on ATG RUP6 [ID 727638.1]
        In 11i
            Run 'Synchronize WF Local Tables'
                See: Synchronize WF Local Tables Is Obsolete And Does Not Need To Be Run [ID 1158212.1]
            Run 'Workflow Directory Services User/Role Validation'
            See: Questions On The "Workflow Directory Services User/Role Validation" Program [ID 369279.1]
            Then clear the Java Middle Tier cache used by Apache i.e.  USER_INFO_CACHE under 'Functional Administrator'
        To clear the JVM Cache (Java Middle Tier cache)
            Use the Caching Framework administration page to clear the cache as required by first signing in as a user with access to the Functional Administrator responsibility.
                Once in the responsibility, select the Core Services tab and then the Caching Framework sub tab.
                Select 'Global Configuration' from the side navigation menu to navigate to the Global Cache Configuration page.
                Under the Cache Policy region, select the Clear All Cache button and answer the prompt that follows to completely flush the cache.
            References
                http://layman-is-oracleappsdba.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-to-clear-cache-in-ebs-11i-and-r12.html
                How To Clear The Cache Using Functional Administrator? (Doc ID 759038.1)
    In R11i and R12 initialize environment variables for a database session as follows:
        exec fnd_global.APPS_INITIALIZE(
            user_id => <user_id>,
            resp_id => <responsibility_id>,
            resp_appl_id => <application_id>);
        this will set your responsibility and user etc
        reference: http://oracleajidba.blogspot.com/2010/06/how-to-set-applications-context.html
            http://garethroberts.blogspot.com/2006/09/setting-your-oracle-applications.html
    In R12 the following is also needed to set the organization after apps.fnd_global.apps_initialize() to set org
        mo_global.init(<application_short_name>)
        This will read the profile option values to initialize MOAC using the security profile
        For GL responsibilities, GL_SECURITY_PKG.INIT; must also be added.
    This procedure sets up global variables and profile values in a database session.
    Call this procedure to initialize the global security context for a database session.
    You can use it for routines such as Java, PL/SQL,
        or other programs that are not integrated with either the Oracle Applications concurrent processing facility
            or Oracle Forms (both of which already do a similar initialization for a database session).
    Concurrent:Report Access Level - profile option hides concurrent jobs from other users (replaced by RBAC in R12)
        R12: How To Configure Access To Request Output Of The Same Responsibility (Doc ID 804296.1)
    Example for AR ....
        select user_id from applsys.fnd_user where user_name = 'GJARMAN';
        select responsibility_id, responsibility_name, application_id from applsys.fnd_responsibility_tl where responsibility_name like 'AR Manager%';
        exec fnd_global.apps_initialize(user_id => 2445, resp_id => 50139, resp_appl_id => 222);
        commit;
        exec mo_global.init('AR');
        commit;
    Push new responsibilites to the homepage
        374309.1 Newly added responsibility is not displayed until Apache is bounced, after applying ATG RUP3
        See Metalink Notes: 417439.1, 356529.1, 356342.1 for background and diagnostics
        Tables used are part of Workflow Directory Services - see workflow notes for table information
        Run 'Synchronize WF LOCAL Tables' to synchronize menu items
        Then Run 'Workflow Directory Services User/Role Validation' using parameters: 10000, Yes, Yes, No
        Alternatively
            Run Concurrent Program: Workflow Directory Services User/Role Validation twice
                first time with the parameters 10000,Y,N,N
                second time with the parameters 10000,N,Y,N
        Then clear the apache cache -> Functional Administrator, Core Services, Caching Framework, click on 'Total Cache Components' number
            Search on USER_INFO_CACHE, select and click 'Clear Cache'
        or, in Caching Framework, click 'Global Configuration' on the left and click 'Clear All Cache'
            See MOS Doc ID  759038.1 How To Clear The Cache Using Functional Administrator.
        Potential workaround - end-date user and un-end-date user
        Also check the records in wf_local_user_roles
        Additional job to run is 'Sync responsibility role data into the WF table'
    All views are registered under the APPS schema regardless of the schema for the underlying table
    Diagnose Oracle Forms through the menu option -> Tools/Examine
        Make sure the profile option 'Hide Diagnostics Menu Entry' is set to No
            Add the function ' FND Diagnostic Menu Entry Read Only' to the menu to make it 'Read-Only'
        You will also need to set 'Utilities:Diagnostics' to 'Yes' if you don't have the APPS password
            In R12 'Function Not Available in this Form'
        choose the SYSTEM block and last query executed to see the actual last query that was run
        You can extract a query performed by a form (last query)
            Navigate to Help/Diagnostics/Examine/Block=System/Field=LastQuery
    Responsibility determines operating unit for subledger access through a profile option (MO:Operating Unit)
        You can examine a profile setting with 'select fnd_profile.value('ORG_ID')' from dual;
    Responsibility also determines set of books for GL access (GL Set of Books Name)
        (which does not have to be the SoB attached to the operating unit for the responsibility)
        You can examine a profile setting with 'select fnd_profile.value('GL_SET_OF_BKS_ID')' from dual;
    Run 'Replicate Seed Data' concurrent process for each operating unit to setup document types etc
        See MOS Note: 134385.1 How to Run the Replicate Seed Data program
        See MOS Note: 274974.1 What Effects Does Replicate Seed Data Concurrent Request Have On Oracle Applications
    The RDA (Remote Diagnostics Agent) System Snapshot is available under the System Administrator application in Oracle Diagnostics
        Also use the responsibility 'Oracle Diagnostics Tool'.
        See MOS Note 559800.1 How To Run Application Collection Tool (ACT/RDA).
        See MOS Note 732091.1 (R12 12.0.6 and above) "R12.0.6+ : All RDA Data Collection Test"
    Print configuration is set to print '0' copies by default - it should be set to '1' by default for  printing
    Default Language Settings
        There are two settings on the personalization page: Current Session Language and Default Session Language
        The Current Session Language is defaulted from the Browser default - not from the 'Default Session Language' setting
        Set the Browser Language default in 'Tools/Internet Options/General/Languages
    You can get the Org_id behind a form with tools > examine
        Change the Blockname as $PROFILE$, choose the field name as ORG_ID
        The value will show the org id in your current session.

        SQL Tracing
            In the forms menu, choose diagnostics and enable trace from the form having the issues
            Note the location of the trace file given by the pop-up window when you enable the trace
            Replicate the issue in the form then turn off trace
            Fetch the file from the file system
            Run tkprof against the file to format the timing statistics
    Forms Runtime Diagnostics (FRD)
        FRD is a runtime event-based logging system intended to aid in the debugging of Forms applications.
        FRD is enabled at runtime on a user by user basis.
        When a form is run with FRD enabled, a combination of external user-application interactions and internal Forms processing events are written in chronological order to a log on the file system.

Table Suffixes
    The simple rule of tables you would want to query:
    No suffix (similar to a base table)
    _B
        Base table. This is the primary table containing the base data - in theory language agnostic. An associated _TL table will have the translated display value (what will be displayed on the applications front end) for a specific code in the base table. If multi language has not been enabled there will be a one to one relationship between base and translation table. (see additional info below)
    _ALL
        If Oracle apps has been configured for multi org then these tables will have the combined data of all operating units.
    _V
        Views, in a lot of cases you may prefer to use the views which are a standardised of viewing data from more than one table
    _VL
        View with language information
    _FVL
        View with resolved lookups instead of only showing the codes
        In some cases you might want to use these tables:
    _A
        Audit tables
    _AVN, _AVC
        Audit view of what was changed, when it was changed and by who
    _F
        Tracked tables, each record associated with the same entity has a start and end date that won't overlap. Used in HR and Payroll.
        In most cases you will ignore unless there is a specfic requirements:
    _TL
        Table with language, is associated with a base or unsuffixed tabled. Contains translations of terms (multi language) relating to the base table. One record in a base table could have many translations.
    _GT
        Global temporary; data only visible by session owner. Will likely be populated when a process on the apps front end has been run, so most of the time you won't see any data in these tables.
    _T
        Seems to be interface tables, that is, it will be populate with records that are to be processed into base and other tables. Not sure if it is consistent
    _ACS
        Analytical criteria sources; assuming if you have analytics enabled this ties the data to the associated analytic tables, otherwise they are not populated.
    _H
        History table; updated only when data from the related tables has been exported (via concurrent job I am assuming), you can trace back exactly what version / state the data was in at the time of export. Useful for analytics perhaps, when the data is being exported to populate a dimension for reporting.
    _INT
        Interim table?? or interface table.
    Multi-language tables and views:
        _TL and _VL extend their associated tables with language information (Multi Language Support) if it is being used by Oracle Apps. For example the TL table contain one or more language indicators for a code so that when it is viewed on the front end it uses the associated values according to the correct language that Oracle Applications has been configured for.
        A simple example would be names of months, January could be code '1' and if language code = 'US' display value = 'January'; 'FR' display value = 'Janvier'; 'SP' display value = 'Enero etc

Overall System Architecture Notes
    References
        https://www.facebook.com/groups/EBS.Sysadmin
    Architecture consists of servers (software service components), nodes (hardware), and tiers (groups of services)
        Database Tier: database, concurrent managers
            For the database, a multiple-node implementation may be achieved
                by implementing Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC).
            Additional information for implementing Oracle RAC is in MetaLink Note 312731.1.
        Concurrent Manager (batch processing) can be implemented on the database tier
            It can also be implemented on a separate node
            Information on Parallel Concurrent Processing (multinode) is in MetaLink Note 185489.1.
        Application Tier: contains forms server (for .fmb and .fmx files), web server (for java and html files),
            The Oracle Application Server is also called iAS, AS, Oracle HTTP Server (OHS), or simply Apache.
                Superceded by WebLogic (WLS), Glassfish and Apache Tomcat
            The iAS listens for incoming requests on a specific port.
            The iAS also runs the JServs that are used to service Java requests.
            For Oracle Applications, the iAS may also be configured to run Forms servlets.
                If this is the case, then the iAS will also service Forms sessions.
                If Forms servlets are not configured for the iAS, then Forms sessions are serviced
            Much like the iAS, the Forms Server listens for incoming requests on a specific port.
                The Forms Node is the nodethat runs the Forms Server.
        Desktop Tier: contains HTML, browser tier
    Overall performance may be significantly improved if Oracle Web Cache
        Additional details on Web Cache is in MetaLink Note 306653.1.

            Working time, waiting time (for locks), I/O
        Rule vs Cost Based Optimization (rule-based optimizer is deprecated)
            Rule based optimizer uses 15 access rules in order of preference
            Cost based optimizer uses a cost value of all components
                Rewrites queries to more optimal structures
    Exectuion Plans show how a query is executed
        Explain Plan - shows expected execution plan and not actual execution used

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Troubleshooting, Tips and Tricks
    You must open periods in order to enter invoices - check open periods in the instance before entering transactions
        Check and open accounting periods -> AP Supervisor -> Accounting -> Control Payable Periods.... and change the period to 'open'
    Enforce batch entry of invoices through the profile option AP: Use Invoice Batch Controls
    If you cannot enter an invoice, batch controls may be enabled so enter a batch first
        If batch entry is enforced, direct invoice entry will throw up a 'find' form and prevent direct entry - enter a batch first
    To do online invoice validation (in Invoice Workbench or on the Batch Summary form)
        You must have the Payables Option (invoice option) 'Allow Online Validation' set on.
        See Payables Options, Invoice, Allow Online Validation
        Note: this is not a profile option so it cannot be enabled at different levels
    Bank Accounts are hard to query - you need the Bank and Branch information first (via the Bank definition form)
        Run a Bank Listing (Bank Account Order) to obtain a list of all account and their corresponding bank names
    You cannot change distribution accounts on a PO matched invoice - see 'Adjusting Invoice Distributions' in Payables user guide
    A generic report can be installed to detect all data corruption issues in notes 1360390.1 and  1361255.1
    Accounting status can be 'Partial' on an invoice if a pre-payment is applied - since the invoice is not fully paid by the prepayment
        Partial Accounting Status indicates there are accounting events referenced by the transaction that are not accounted

    Note: the option to allow online invoice validation is not a Profile Option
        See the AP Invoice Option 'Allow Online Validation'
    AP: Use AP Batch Controls - set at the site level to enable batch entry of invoices and access to the invoice workbench
        Prevents an invoice from being entered without a batch and greys out the Invoice Entry form if a batch is not already created
    AP: Use Automatic Tax Calculation - to enable Accounts Payable to calculate taxes
    AP: Enforce Tax from Purchase Order - preempts the tax calculated in AP with the Purchase Order taxes

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on General Functionality
    For multi-org, vendors are accessible globally across all organizations, but vendor sites are specific to an Operating Unit
        Because of this, default accounting is only at the Site level - there is no default accounting setup at the Supplier level
    Many processes in AP can be automated by implementing purchasing and putting the terms and conditions on the purchase order
    Payables can be installed without Purchasing or Cash Management but many of the features in Payables cannot be used
    Expense report entry and payment for employees are within the scope of Accounts Payable functions
    Attachments to invoices support scanned or other electronic documents
        This feature is most useful for recording a paper-based account coding processes
    Three methods of accounting are supported (setup on the Payables Options form):
        Cash (no liability is recorded, just the cash payment credit and the asset, clearing or expense debit),
        Accrual (the liability is accrued and subsequently cleared by the cash payment) and
        Both (two Sets of Books and both accounting methods are employed)
    Encumbrances are created when a PO is issued, and convert to an accrued payables liability on receipt of goods.
    The accrued liability coverts to a payable liability on receipt or generation of the supplier invoice.
        The liability is eliminated when payment is made
    Some companies recognize the liability on receipt of the invoice and not on receipt of the goods
        This is common if the company does not have an automated purchasing system
        The dates used to accrue and recognize a liability is a commercial decision
    Payment Terms at the Supplier level and Site level can be renegotiated and over-ridden at the purchase order level
    Back-logged invoices (received but not coded for charges or entered) should be summed prior to month-end and accrued manually
        The manual liability accrual can be a summary liability journal direct to the GL (as a reversing journal)
    Manual accruals are also common for monthly expenses not invoiced (e.g. electric bills, phone bills, rent and pCard statements)
    Prepayments can be advance payments or deposits/partial payments sent with a purchase order. They are treated as assets until the supplier invoice is received
    Prepayments are treated as early invoices
        they credit the supplier liability account (defaulted from the supplier site) and
        debit the prepayment account (again, defaulted from the supplier site or over-ridden on invoice entry).
        Actual remittance of the prepayment offsets the supplier liability and reduces cash.
            The prepayment asset remains (as a net shift from cash to prepayment assets).
            When the final invoice payment is made, both cash and the prepayment are credited off.
    Invoices for assets are identified by the 'Track as Asset' checkbox on the Invoice workbench in the distributions line or invoice lines
    The concurrent program 'Create Mass Additions' must be run to send the item to Fixed Assets.
        The debit account charged to the invoice line for an asset purchase is normally an asset clearing account
            which will be cleared to the correct debit account when the asset is created.

            Payments (payment accounting events excluding reconciliation events in the Payment Document Class)
            Reconciled Payments (payment reconciliation accounting events in the payment document class)
                Payment reconciliation events are raised when reconciling bank statements
    Journals are sent to the General Ledger through a concurrent process 'Transfer to GL'
        They are imported if the 'Submit Journal Import' option is chose in the 'Payables Transfer to GL' process
    Accounting Events are raised in Accounts Payable to create Journal Entries
        They are raised by different actions or processes and include:
            Invoices (when 'Create Accounting' is run)
            Invoice Adjustments
            Invoice Cancellation
            Prepayment Application (prepayment)
            Prepayment Unapplication
            Payments
            Payment Maturity
            Payment Adjustment
            Payment Cancellation
            Payment Clearing/Unclearing
    There are three tables in Accounts Payable that store accounting transactions for all accounting events
        AP_ACCOUNTING_EVENTS_ALL - one line for each event for all Sets of Books (e.g. for MRC there are multiple Sets of Books)
           linked back to the source by a SOURCE_TABLE and SOURCE_ID such as an invoice or payment)
        AP_AE_HEADERS_ALL - one line for each accounting event for each Set of Books
        AP_AE_LINES_ALL - one line for each debit and credit under an accounting event header
            linked back to a source table such as AP_INVOICES for liabilities or AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS for charges
    Journal transactions for new invoices are created in AP using the 'Create Accounting' concurrent program
        This program creates an Accounting Event 'Invoices' for each invoice it processes
            It can be submitted directly for a single invoice from the Invoice Actions Form in Accounts Payable
            It also creates accounting for payments if the 'All' Journal Category parameter is chosen
            Accounting transactions created by this process must be 'Transfered to GL' separately.
        'Create Accounting' builds the liability account and creates accounting records for liabilities and charges
            'Create Accounting' does not build the charge for each invoice line
            The expense or asset charge account is entered with the invoice or extracted from the matching purchase order
            Journals are posted to the GL using the 'Payables Transfer to General Ledger' concurrent process.
            Reference: Accounts Payable User Guide 11.5.10.2 pp 8.24 'Payables Transfer to GL Program'
        This program also has an option to transfer MRC book entries
            If MRC entries exist, they are separate AP_AE_HEADERS_ALL lines for a single line in AP_ACCOUNTING_EVENTS_ALL
        This covers both payments and invoices (journal category = 'All' in the concurrent manager parameters)
    The 'Payables Accounting Process' is a concurrent program that processes several child processes
        Create Accounting - to create the journal entries locally in the Accounting Entries table
        Payables Transfer to General Ledger
        GL Journal Import
        Journal Posting
    AP Liability Balances are maintained on a table AP_LIABILITY_BALANCES
        At the time of invoice approval and payment confirmation a line in ap_accounting_events_all gets populated with an event_status of CREATED.
        The corresponding accounting_event_id gets populated and the posted_flag remains N in the base table of ap_invoice_distributions or ap_invoice_payments_all.
        Run the concurrent process Payables Create Accounting, the posted_flag switches to Y and the event status in ap_accounting_events_all table changes to ACCCOUNTED or ACCOUNTED WITH ERROR.  Then the ap_ae_headers_all and ap_ae_lines_all get created.
        When the data gets transferred to the GL the transfer_flag = Y and the transfer_run_id gets populated in ap_ae_headers_all.  The detail data in ap_ae_lines_all gets tranferred to the GL and the gl_sl_link_id in ap_ae_lines_all gets populated.
        A permanent table ap_liability_balance was introduced.  Each time the transfer to GL is process the Liability data from ap_ae_lines_all gets populated in ap_liability_
    Exercise: View accounting entries transfered to General Ledger -> Payables Manager/Accounting/View Accounting Lines
        This provides a view of accounting entries and allows editing of accounting lines.
        Also view the accounting entries in T-account format at the individual entry level.
    Exercise: Create accounting entries for invoices and payments -> Payables Manager/Other/Concurrent Requests
        Submit 'Payables Accounting Process'.
        Choose 'Transfer to GL' and 'Submit Journal Import' options as 'Yes' to push unposted journals into the GL

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on General Setups

        Paygroups are a purchasing lookup code set (Navigation: Lookups -> Purchasing)

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Taxes and Tax Codes in 11i (same as Tax Names)
    Taxes on invoices from suppliers can be calculated automatically and GL distributions created
        the tax calculation is done in Accounts Payable but not in Purchasing
            i.e. there are no estimated taxes
    Taxes are defaulted in one of several ways:
        from Purchase Orders,
        defaulted from the AP Tax Hierarchy
        Entered manually as Tax Codes during invoice entry
    Tax defaulting from Purchase Orders or the Tax Hiearchy can be turned off
        Tax codes can still be entered with invoices if calculated outside Oracle
    Any tax rules and defaults setup in the Tax Hierarchy are overwritten on a manual purchase order
        This is done by the purchase order preferences setups for a user.
    Each tax code is one of four predefined or 'seeded' lookup code tax types:
        sales
        use
        offset
        withholding
    Tax Codes (ie Tax Names) have a tax rate and charge account.
        The tax rate is assigned to each Tax Code in the tax codes window.
    AP validates the Tax Name and the Tax Account distribution against the set up for the Tax Name
        This is done during invoice approval to ensure the account is correct for any Tax lines imported from external sources
    You enable automatic tax calculation by setting the profile option "Use Automatic Tax Calculation" in Accounts Payable
        If you don't do this in 11i then the Tax Engine in R12 will be set to not calculate taxes automatically
    AP will not do tax calculations if auto tax calculation is turned off
        However it will accept tax lines through invoice entry if the tax code and tax amount are entered
    Tax Codes defined in AP assign the GL charge account for taxes, the tax type and the tax rate associated with the code.
    Tax Codes can be individual rates or groups of rates defined in Tax Groups
    Tax Groups allow you to assign a group of tax codes to a single line
        Each Tax Code in the Tax Group is calculated as a distribution on the invoice
    Sales and Use Taxes
        Sales Taxes are levied by the supplier, paid to the origin tax jurisdiction and included on the supplier invoice
        Use Taxes are paid to the destination jurisdiction and must be withheld and reported by the purchaser
        Use Taxes make up for sales taxes not collected by giving a jurisdiction income on goods used
        Use tax is paid to make up for sales tax not collected
            e.g. for imported goods where the supplier in the origin state is subject to a lower tax rate
                Note that some states do not collect sales tax if the goods are used in another state
        It is the buyers responsibility to declare and pay use tax and not the seller's responsibility to collect
            This is because the seller is normally outside the taxing jurisdiction
    Tax defaults at the supplier site level include:
        tax code (as part of the tax hierarchy),
        calculation level (invoice or line or tax code),
        rounding rule etc.
    AP defaults tax codes on invoice lines based on the tax hierarchy in AP or purchasing
        Members of the tax hierarchy are:
            Financial Options
            Ship-To (destination location)
            Item
            Supplier
            Supplier Site (ie Ship-From)
    The profile option 'AP: Enforce Tax from Purchase Order' overrides the assignment of taxes in Accounts Payable
        It enforces the PO tax value instead of defaulting the tax from the hierarchy
    Taxes can be charged to the distribution on the shipment line or to the distribution recorded against the tax code
    The charge method depends on the tax calculation method used when entering invoices:
        manual - enter taxes manually
        prorate - allocate total tax down to the lines based on amounts
        auto -
        Manual requires entering an invoice tax line manually
            it uses the tax account distribution on the tax code definition to build the charge account
        Prorate requires tagging each invoice line and entering a total tax amount to spread
            it uses the charge account on each invoice line (ie adds the tax to the line amount)
            Each prorated tax amount creates a separate distribution line
        Auto requires entering the tax code/name on each line and clicking 'Calculate Tax'
            Oracle will calculate a new tax line for each distribution line with a tax code and use the ledger charge account recorded with the code
            An automatically calculated tax line references it's parent item, freight or miscellaneous charge line on the invoice
            The description field on the auto calculated tax line is not populated and a manual description must be entered
                Normally the description is the tax name concatenated with the description from the corresponding parent taxable shipment line
    Recalculation of automatic taxes is triggered by:
        calculate tax button,
        invoice validation
        when using the View and Update Tax Summary window
    Profile Option 'AP: Enforce Tax from Purchase Order' - enforces the tax code on the purchase order regardless of the tax hierarchy result
    Exercise: Enable Automatic Tax Calculation ->

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Account Distributions, Adjustments and Distribution Sets
    Account distributions are created at the time of invoice entry (into Invoice Gateway or Workbench), automatically from Distribution Sets assigned to supplier sites, or by matching to purchase orders
    Accounting distributions are attached to suppliers at the supplier site level and apply to all invoices posted to the site (if a distribution is not entered on the invoice line)
    Account distrubution sets can be attached to supplier sites separately for liabilities, prepayments and future dated payments (ie liability accounts or the credit side of the invoice - not the debit side which is coded at the time of invoice entry)
    Based on the accounts in the distribution set, liability account code combinations are subsequently stamped/carried at the supplier site level in AP_INVOICES. The asset or expense account distribution is carried at the invoice line level in AP_INVOICE_DISTRIBUTIONS
    A distribution set is a set of liability accounts that can be associated with multiple supplier sites if the accounting is the same for multiple suppliers.
    A full distribution set identifies the accounts to charge and the percentage allocation of amounts for each account
    A skeleton distribution set identifies the accounts to charge but does not specify percentages - the actual values for each account are entered at the time of invoice entry
    Account aliases can be entered when setting up a distribution set to use a shortcut to enter the account value in the set.
    Exercise: Create a distributions set -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Setup/Invoices/Distribution Sets, and enter account distributions and charge percentages
    eBS Payables: How To Adjust Invoice Distributions [ID 215019.1]

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Automatic Offsets (Segment Balancing)
    Used to split up the liability line into subtotals based on the balancing segment in the charge lines
    Set in the Accounting tab of the Payables Options form in Payables
        None - no offsets are made
        Balancing - offsets are by balancing segment
        Account - offsets are by all segments except the the account

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Document Sequences for Invoices and Payments
    Document sequences can be assigned to invoices and payments as voucher numbers to provide sequential numbering of documents
    The purpose of voucher numbers is to ensure all documents are processed and any gaps in documents are identified and resolved.
    Document sequences can be manually provided through direct entry, through the interface API, fully automatic, or disabled
    Document types must be defined and then sequence rules assigned to those types to show manual or automatic assignment
    Exercise: Create document sequence for invoices: GL Superuser -> Setup -> Financials -> Sequences -> Define
    Profile Option: Sequential Numbering - has several settings that define how vouchers are assigned (see AP Users Guide)

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Supplier Setup:
    Suppliers are identified by an alphanumberic Supplier Number which is automatically assigned at setup,
        Suppliers have sites for purchasing, RFQ, and payment (where payments are remitted).
        Invoices cannot be entered for Suppliers without a paysite
    A supplier site carries accounting information specific to an operating unit's legal entity and set of books
        Suppliers are global and do not carry any accounting information (except default values)
    A Supplier Site can be one or multiple types of sites (eg Purchasing + Payment + pCard)
    Defaults for setting up suppliers are held in the Payables Options
    The Supplier Account is an inception to date history of all supplier transactions and unpaid amounts.
        Click the 'Calculate Balance Owed' button on the 'Find Invoices' button to retrieve the total owed
    Supplier information is shared with Purchasing and suppliers can be maintained in Purchasing or Payables systems equally.
        This is the PO_VENDORS and PO_VENDOR_SITES tables
        This is moved to the AP schema in R12 as AP_SUPPLIERS and AP_SUPPLIER_SITES
    Suppliers can be merged by moving sites or combining sites. Duplicate vendors can be discovered on the Supplier Audit Report
    Employees must be setup as suppliers (type 'Employee') in order to submit expense reports
    Access to setting up suppliers should be secured to a responsibility so that it is difficult for fraudulent supplier setups to occur
    Exercise: Enter a new supplier -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Suppliers/Entry, to enter a supplier and suppier site details
    Exercise: Merge suppliers -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Suppliers/Supplier Merge, to merge two dupicate suppliers, transfer invoices and purchase orders, and inactivate one of the supplier records.

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Banks and Bank Accounts
    In 11i
        All internal (disbursement) and external (direct deposit) banks and accounts are setup in AP
    In R12
        All internal banks are setup in Cash Management (roles can be granted to allow setup in Payables responsibilities)
        All external banks are setup in Supplier Setup and stored in the Payments Schema
            Create the bank at the supplier level and assign it to the site level.
            Reference: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdu7iXrEa0Q&list=PLT1gXLhlHxY07CwOwwRxOKHpMigZjFM5T -- setup an R12 Bank Account for a Supplier

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Invoices and Approvals:
    Troubleshooting - if you cannot enter an invoice, batch controls may be enabled so enter a batch first
        With batch control turned on, direct invoice entry will only allow a 'find' action, and display a find form
    The Invoice Workbench is a series of forms that start by accessing invoice batches or invoices.
        Most forms link off the invoices form (distributions, holds, actions, payment, etc)
    The number on the Actions button on the Invoice workbench represents the number of invoices selected on the form that the actions will apply toward
    The details accessible in the invoice workbench depend on the invoice type:
        standard,
        credit memo (notice from supplier of adjustment they made),
        debit memo (notice to supplier of adjustment you are making),
        expense report,
        PO default (match to PO),
        Quickmatch (automatch to PO),
        Mixed (positive or negative amt) or
        Prepay (to make advance payments prior to receipt)
    Credit and debit memos have the same effect.
        They reduce the amount of liability to a supplier (ie reduce the invoice amount).
        The only difference is 'who' issues the memo. Suppliers issue credits and buyers issue debits
    Invoice matching can be two way, three way and four way (with PO, Receipts and Accepted Receipts/Inspections)
                Invoice matching is done at the shipment line level or the distribution line level on the purchase order, not at the PO line level.
    Invoice Gateway provides for high volume invoice entry into the Payables Open Interface Table for subsequent import and validation
    A standard invoice batch name convention should be established - eg initials and date and batch number (ie GGJ-05252003-001)
    Approvals for invoices can be made as the invoices are entered or separately through the 'Payables Approval' concurrent process. Invoices can be entered in batches, individually, in ranges or selectively
    Most invoices are intended for automatic approval without manual intervention - the approvals concurrent process can be scheduled to run frequently to approve new invoices and retest the conditions of invoices put on hold by an earlier run
    The approval process runs multiple validations: PO matching, tax, period status, exchange rates and account distributions
    Invoices cannot be entered unless the invoice period is open, via the Control Payables Periods form
    Invoices must be validated and approved before they are paid and invoices the fail validation are put on system hold
        Validation can be done online through invoice actions on the invoice workbench
            It can also be done via the AP Batch form, or through the approval concurrent process (Invoice Approval Workflow)
        To do online invoice validation, you must have the AP Option (invoice option) 'Allow Online Validation' set on
            See Payables Options, Invoice, Allow Online Validation
    Approval holds are put on invoices during validation if they fail certain tests, like line/header total balances, incorrect tax amount, unbalanced accounting distributions etc.
    Holds are put on invoices by the approval processing or by a user manually
    Accounting treatment for expense invoices is DR Expense, DR Tax Expense, CR Supplier Liability Accout (ie Payables) (unless the liability is already accrued from earlier receipt of goods)
    Accounting treatment for credit and debit memos is the reverse of invoices so it will CR Expense (or asset), CR Tax Expense, and DR Liability (ie Payables)
    Invoices can be matched to purchase orders, and the accounting for the debit entry will be taken from the matched PO lines
    Exercise: Enter invoices in non-batch mode -> PM/Invoices/Entry/Invoices
    Exercise: Enter invoices in batch mode -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Invoices/Entry/Invoice Batches, and specify a batch name to enter invoices
    Exercise: Enter invoice and default/match PO terms -> PAYABLES ENTRY/Invoices/Entry/Invoices, and set the Type to 'PO Default'.  Enter the invoice and click on 'Match' to find the PO and enter the actual matching details between the PO and invoice.

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Adjustments, Credit Notes and Debit Notes:
    An invoice can be adjusted if it has not been accounted
        This can be done even if it is paid
        If an invoice is accounted, individual lines can be reversed and reentered but not modified
    An invoice can have distributions changed after it is paid if the option is enabled
        Reference: R12.1: Invoice and Invoice Distribution Adjustment Charts - Explains what Fields can be Adjusted on an Invoice and when the System Prevents Update [ID 1300685.1]
        Set the Payables Option (Invoice tab) 'Allow Adjustments to Paid Invoices' to 'Yes'
        This does not apply to prepayment invoices that are applied to other invoices
    A credit memo is an adjustment to an invoice or an account credit from the supplier
        It can be an adjustment for damage, pricing or billing errors
        It credits the customer's AR account by reducing the receivable booked by the supplier
        A credit note can also be raised locally by a customer to correct an invoice entry error
            In this case the supplier would not have any record of the credit
    A debit memo is an adjustment to an invoice or an account credit raised by the customer
        It is sent to the supplier
        It can be for damaged goods or returned goods or an invoicing error
        It debits the customer's payable liability to reduce it
    The debit memo in Accounts Payable is different to a debit memo defined in Accounts Receivable
        A debit memo in Accounts Receivable is a charge to the customer's account for an underbilling
        A debit memo in Accounts Receivable is sent to the customer, just as a Credit Note is sent
    An AP Credit Note can be entered directly into AP or matched to an existing invoice.
        The matching process allows the distributions from the original invoice to be copied over
        Matching does not close out (pay) the invoice - both the invoice and credit note must be included in a pay run
    You can match credit/debit memos to invoices in the Invoice Workbench
        Quick Invoices window does not allow you to do that.
        You can two options available in R12 to perform the match. 
        Using Quick Credit functionality:
            1: Create a credit memo in the Invoice WorkBench. Enter a Negative amount.
            2: Navigate to the Quick Credit checkbox. Check this box.
            3: In the Next field enter the Invoice Number of the invoice you want to match this memo to.
            4: Save your work. CTRL+S
            Regardless of the actual amount on the credit memo, invoice lines and distributions will be created from the original invoice's lines and distributions.
        Using Correction Functionality:
            This is how matching was done in 11i. 
            In Release 12 an invoice match is considered a correction and is done using the Correction button.
            Do not use the Match button. That is for performing the matching with POs.
            1: Enter a Credit/Debit Memo in the Invoice Workbench. Enter a negative amount. Do not manually enter the distributions. 
            2: In the Match Action field scroll to Match Action field. Using drop down select Invoice. 
            3: Click on the Correction button.
            4: Enter search criteria for the invoice, in the Find Documents for Correction window. Click on the Find button. 
            Payables navigates to the Invoice Corrections window.
            To see more information about an invoice, you can select it and click on the Invoice Overview button.
            5: Select the invoice and enter a negative/Credit Amount.
            You can do the line level matching by clicking on Select Lines button. 
            Select each invoice line you want to match to and enter a Credit Amount.
            6: Choose the Correct button to correct the invoice.
            To review the new invoice lines, choose the lines tab from the Invoices window.

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Invoice Import Gateway (Open Interface Invoice Import)
    The open interface invoice import uses overlay account logic to build account charge distributions for invoices, starting with a distribution set tied to the supplier site level and overlaid by account, balancing segment and cost center segment values loaded in the interface table with the invoices.

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Invoice Entry And Adjustments with PO Matching:
    Three types of invoices can be PO matched through the invoice workbench: Standard, PO Default and Mixed
    If you enter PO Default at the invoice type, payables defaults the supplier, supplier number and currency from the purchase order
    The GL date is the date on the invoice accounting transaction for the liability and the charge accounts, and defaults from other dates on the transaction based on a ruleset
    Click on the Match checkbox to allow a line to be editable on the 'Match to Purchase Orders' window.
    Exercise: Match invoice to purchase order -> PAYABLES MANAGER/....../Match to Purchase Orders
    Matching to a Purchase Order places limitations on invoice adjustments
        You cannot change distributions on PO matched invoices in R12 (possible in 11i)
        You can change tax determining attributes but these will not adjust tax distributions from matched purchase order lines

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Invoice Approval Workflow:
    References
        APINV - How Do I Setup AP to Use Invoice Approval Workflow? (Doc ID 315269.1)
    Invoice approval workflow routes invoices to designated individuals for approval based on approval rules in Oracle Approvals Manager (AME)
    Several invoice types are excluded from invoice approval workflow
        expense reports (already approved in self service),
        recurring invoices (which are approved in advance), and
        pre-existing invoices (before approvals are activated)
    The Invoice Approval Workflow can exempt certain invoices from approval based on rules
    Approvals are activated by changing the Approval Status field in the Invoices form to 'Required'
    The invoice approval workflow can be submitted  from the Submit Requests form or
        from the Invoice Actions form or through concurrent manager
    Exercise: Submit Invoice Approvals Workflow from Concurrent Manager
        -> from Concurrent Manager - select 'Invoice Approval Workflow Program'
            and choose params: Supplier, Invoice, Date To/From

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Prepayments:
    Prepayments are a type of invoice you entere to make an advance payment to a supplier
        You can have these advance payments or deposits/partial payments sent with a purchase order.
        They are treated as assets similar to cash until the supplier invoice is received
        They are later applied to the final invoice as a form of payment or partial payment
    Examples can include expense advances for employees and deposits on leases
    Prepayments are implemented as early invoices
        They credit the supplier liability account (defaulted from the supplier site)
        They debit the prepayment account (again, defaulted from the supplier site or over-ridden on invoice entry).
        Actual remittance of the prepayment offsets the supplier liability and reduces cash.
        The prepayment asset remains (as a net shift from cash to prepayment assets).
        When the final invoice payment is made the prepayment are credited off.
            The original prepayment created the expense or asset debit/charge which remains
    Prepayments are entered as new invoices (since issuing the prepayment is a separate step), with invoice type = 'Prepayment'.
        They also require a settlement date - the date after which the prepayment can be applied to the invoice
        They also require a subtype - Temporary or Permanent.
            Only temporary prepayments can be applied to invoices
            Permanent prepayments can eventually be refunded but cannot be applied to invoices (e.g. Lease Deposits)
    The GL liability account will default to the prepayment account from the supplier site.
    Prepayments are applied to the final invoice by entering the final invoice, then choosing invoice actions to apply prepayments
        Available prepayments will be displayed for a single supplier and can be applied individually
        If the prepayment invoice is not fully paid itself (i.e. it is unpaid or partially paid), it will not show as available for matching to an invoice
    Conditions that apply to prepayments include:
        They can be matched to purchase orders
        They can be put on hold
        Prepayments are paid like any other invoice but they cannot be partially paid - they must be paid in full.
    Payables notifies you in the invoice workbench when a prepayment is available to apply to a supplier invoice
    Prepayments can be applied in: Invoice Workbench, Quick Invoices, Expense Reports and Internet Expenses
    The default prepayment account is set at the supplier site, supplier and Financial Options
    Profile Options
        Build Prepay Account When Matching Payables - to automatically create a PO match for a prepayment matched to a purchase order

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Recurring Invoices:
    Recurring invoices require a special calendar before they can be defined
    Lease payments can be setup as recurring invoices
    Exercise: Setup a special calendar for a recurring invoice -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Setup/Calendar/Special Calendar, and choose recurring invoice as the type.
    Exercise: Setup a recurring invoice definition -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Invoice/Entry/Recurring Invoice, and associate a calendar and a distribution set for accounts
    Exercise: Generate a recurring invoice from its definition -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Invoice/Entry/Recurring Invoice, and query the definition, specify the number of invoices to generate and click on 'Generate..'

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Cancelling Invoices
    Reference: Accounts Payable User Guide
    You can cancel only unpaid invoices, unpaid invoices already selected for payment and invoices that are not on hold
    Unvalidated invoices can also be cancelled.
    Cancelling an invoice does the following:
        Sets the invoice amount to zero
        Sets all scheduled payments to zero
        Reverses all distributions
        Unmatches any PO matched amounts
        Submits invoice validation
        Updates the status of the invoice to 'Cancelled'

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Quick, Manual and Batch Payments:
    Manual Payments are payments made outside Oracle and recorded after the fact
        To enter a manual payment and have a valid value for Bank in the Bank LOV:
        You must have a Bank Account with a Payment Document that has either 'Recorded' or 'Combined' Payment Document Disbursement Type
        The Payment Document must also be assigned a Payment Format that has a Payment Method of 'Clearing' or 'Check'
        If all Payment Documents have a Payment Method of 'Electronic' there will be no allowable values for 'Bank' when entering a manual payment
            Navigation: Banks -> (Query Bank) -> Accounts -> Payables Documents -> Disbursement Type
    Quick Payments are entered via the Payments Workbench or they can be initiated from the Invoice Workbench
        To enter a quick payment you must know a Supplier and Site with an unpaid or partially paid invoice first
        Run an 'Invoice Aging Report' to get a list of all unpaid or partially paid invoices (set 'Include Invoice Detail = Yes')
        Run an 'Accounts Payable Trial Balance' to get a list of all unpaid or partially paid invoices posted to GL
    Navigation: Payments -> Entry -> Payments
        Type = 'Quick' (defaulted)
        A new document (check number) is reserved automatically once the Document Type is specified
        The Payment Date is defaulted to the System Date
        Payment Batches
            Navigation: Payments -> Entry -> Batches
    Payment methods are manual check, system-generated check, EFT, wire transfer, pCard (followed up by payment to the pCard vendor)
    Payment runs are scheduled to run periodically and pay all pending and approved invoices to a single supplier in a single check
    Pay Alone is an option on an invoice to ensure a separate payment is made for the invoice and other invoices are not combined into the payment
    Payments are initiated through the payment workbench in batches which select all due invoices within a specified pay group
    Manual payments are made outside the system and recorded afterwards with the appropriate accounting distributions
    Quickpays are single payments to a vendor made within the system, but not using batch payment controls.
        They can be issued from the invoice workbench directly, or from the payment workbench after selecting the invoice
    Accounting treatment of payables is DR Payables Liability Account, CR Cash or Cash Clearing Account (cash clearing is used if the extra step of reconciling cash accounts is taken, to CR cash and DR cash clearing)
    There is no tax expense entry generated by a payment transaction - tax expense is part of the original liability posting from the invoice.
    Exercise: Initiate payments in batch mode -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Payments/Entry/Payment Batches, to pay all due invoices in a paygroup
    Exercise: Make a quickpayment or record a manual payment -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Payments/Entry/Payments, and specify the payment type as Quick, or Manual. Enter the payment and reserve the check number, then click Enter/Adjust Invoices to tag the invoice being paid

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Multicurrency Payments
    You can make payments in different currencies from a bank account if it is defined as a functional currency account
        If the bank account currency is not the functional currency it can only make payments in the currency of the account
    Implementing a multi-currency payment account requires the following steps
        Set the 'Multiple Currency Payments' flag on the Payables Options of the Bank Account
            You can only set this flag if it is also set in Payables Options for the Operating Unit
        Set the Payment format as 'Multiple Currency'

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Payment Batches
    Enter a Payment Batch by Creating a Batch Name and Pay Date (defaults to System Date)
        Navigation: Payments -> Entry -> Payment Batches
        Enter criteria to limit the invoices that are paid, including Paygroup and Supplier
    Payment Batch Statuses
        New - a batch has been entered but no payments created (these batches can be deleted rather than cancelled0
        Selecting (in progress) - a process is running to build payments
        Built - invoices have been selected and proposed payments built but payment numbers have not been assigned.
        Preliminary Payment Register - can be run at any time after a batch is built to review payments
        Cancelled - you can cancel a batch before it is formatted for payment and confirmed (marked as 'Paid')
        Rebuilding - payments have been modified and 'Rebuild' selected
        Formatting (in progress) - a payment batch is having it's payments formatted and printed
        Formatted - a payment batch has been formatted and payment numbers are assigned
        Confirmed - sets the invoice payment status to 'Paid' and automatically prints a 'Final Payment Register'
            Associates the payment number with the invoice
            Updates payment history
        Accounting Created
    Batches can be modified or cancelled after they are built and before they are paid
        Cancel a batch by choosing actions, unchecking 'Format Payments' and checking 'Cancel Payment Batch'
        You can cancel a batch that has had payments formatted by unchecking 'Confirm Payments' and checking 'Cancel Payment Batch'
        You can also cancel a batch after payments have been confirmed
    Modifying a Payment Batch
        Modify a batch by choosing Actions, unchecking 'Format Payments' and checking 'Modify Payment Batch ...'
            This displays the 'Modify Payment Batch' form
            Exclude a supplier from the batch by setting the 'Pay' field to 'No'
            Force payment on an invoice by choosing 'Force'
            Change the amount paid for each invoice by setting the 'Payment Amount Maximum' to the limit amount
            Further reduce the amount paid on an invoice by increasing the 'Discount Amount' on each invoice
            Insert new invoices by creating new payment records and choosing eligible invoices
    Format a Payment Batch to Create a Payment File or Print Payments as Checks and Remittances
        Query the batch and choose Actions - and make sure 'Format Payments' is checked
    Confirm a Payment Batch (set Invoice Status to 'Paid')
        Query a payment batch which has had it's payments formatted
        Choose 'Actions' and check 'Confirm Payment Batch' and click 'OK'
            The 'Confirm Payment Batch' form will display
            Edit the document ranges (create new lines) and set the status to: Printed, Setup, Skipped or Spoiled
                A 'Setup' is to set the printer alignment - choose 'Setup' if the document is a setup check only
            If 'Skipped' or 'Spoiled' is chosen, Oracle will leave the status of the invoice as unpaid
        The status of individual payments within a confirmed payment batch is set to 'Negotiable'
    Create Accounting
        Choose a Confirmed Payment Batch, choose 'Actions' and check 'Create Accounting'

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Expense Reports:
    References: Expense Reports and Credit Cards - Accounts Payable Users Guide
    Expense reports can be entered directly into payables or can be populated from approved Internet (Self Service) Expense report submissions
    Expense reports can be created in several ways:
        Entry directly into Accounts Payable
        Entry into Internet Expenses
        Entry into Oracle Projects (and then transfered from Projects to Payables)

            AP_EXPENSE_REPORTS_ALL for the template headers
            AP_EXPENSE_REPORT_PARAMS_ALL for the lines
        Employee defaults specify the types of expenses that can be charged, and the dollar limit for receipts required
    Advances can be applied against expense reports in the expense report entry form
        If the tolerance limit has not been established, the advances will not appear
    Exercise: Enter an expense report -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Invoices/Entry/Expense Reports, and enter expenses as accounting lines
    Exercise: Setup an expense template -> PAYABLES MANAGER/Setup/Invoice/Expense Report Templates
        Specify items, receipt required amount, and expense account distributions

Accounts Payable (AP Schema) Notes on Interfaces:
    The Payables Open Interface is used to import invoices and expense reports into Oracle AP
    Run 'Payables Open Interface Import' to import
    Run 'Payables Open Interface Purge Program
    The interface process loads invoices through open interface tables
        AP_INVOICES_INTERFACE - invoice headers
        AP_INVOICE_LINES_INTERFACE - invoice lines
    SQL-Loader can be used to load flat files of invoices and invoice lines into the interface tables
    Invoice Import can be used to import invoices from non-Oracle systems, large suppliers or during data conversion.
    The Payables Open Interface is also used to import invoices from other Oracle systems:
        lease payment obligations from Property Manager,
        iSupplier invoices from the iSupplier Portal,
        credit card transactions,
        Fixed Assets lease payments, etc
    The tables loaded in the interface are the AP_INVOICES_INTERFACE and AP_INVOICE_LINES_INTERFACE
        Rejections are stored in AP_INTERFACE_REJECTIONS
    Once entered through the Invoice Open Interface, the invoices can be viewed in the Invoice Workbench within Oracle AP
    Invoice Gateway can also be used to enter invoices into the interface tables
        The Invoice Gateway form is a faster way to enter invoices than using the Invoice Workbench
        There are fewer edits and validations performed on invoices when entered through the gateway

    You can search for customers using wildcards in customer setup by adding a leading space (e.g. ' %LTD%' will return all customers with 'LTD' in the name)
    You must run the 'Replicate Seeded Data' process before setting up AR
        This will create the seeded transaction types and activities you need to allow forms to open
    To create a customer from a supplier record
        Profile Option 'AR: Show Parties Without Accounts In DQM' Allows Supplier Parties to be Queried in Customer Maintenance to create Customer Accounts
        Profile Option 'HZ: Enable DQM Party Search' enables advanced search
    Open Invoices means AR invoices with a balance
        On AR_PAYMENT_SCHEDULES_ALL there is a STATUS column indicating OP or CL

        AR: Allow Overapplication in Lockbox -- allow receipts to overapply to invoices in lockbox
        AR: Cash  Allow Actions -- hides or shows the Chargeback and Adjustments buttons on the Applications page in Receipts workbench. As part of the cash application process, the applier has the option to create adjustments (write-offs) and chargebacks if you set this option to Yes. I recommend that you do that, you can always control the amounts they write-off using approval limits.
        AR: Create Bank Charges -- enables bank charge entry on receipts and makes the Bank Charge account required on Receipt methods
        AR: Default Exchange Rate Type (Default is 'Corporate')
        AR: Show Parties Without Accounts In DQM -- to select suppliers in Customer Maintenance
        AR: Always Default Transaction Balance for Applications - defaults the application amount to the full transaction amount in receipt application
        HZ: Enable DQM Party Search enables advanced search
        AR: Allow Transaction Batching - If you enter small volumes of manual transactions, it is not necessary to use batches for transactions. If you enter high volumes, you should use batching for transactions. You should always use batching for receipts since you get immediate feedback of what you have done and any potential problems.
        AR: Cash - Default Amount Applied - Always set so the default is the amount remaining on the receipt, not the amount remaining on the invoice. If you allow the receipt amount to default to the invoice balance, this allows you to apply more than you really have.
        AR: Change Customer Name - In reality customers change their names and this is a valuable feature but, I recommend that you set it "Yes" only after to have been live for a few weeks. This is a good way to keep novice users from overlaying good names with invalid names, until the know what they are doing.
        AR: Close Period - Run Collections Effectiveness - I recommend that you set this option to "No." Most users do not use this report and it will just slow the close process.
        AR: Update Due Date - Allow change to due date. In rare instances it is desirable to change the due date on an invoice (for example, you have negotiated this with the customer). By setting this profile option to "Yes," you have the option of doing this. What this really does is to allow you to make your aging look better. Consider whether or not this is desirable in you business situation.
        AR: Query Criteria check - disable the warning when blind querying in AR (None, Warning, Error)
        AR: Use Invoice Accounting For Credit Memo - In most cases, if you know the original invoice, it is desirable to offset the accounts that were used for the invoice when creating the related Credit Memo. This option allows you to do that.

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on System Options
    AR: Allow Payment of Unrelated Invoices -- set to Yes to allow payments to be applied to other customers transactions

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR) Notes on Procedures
    Delete an Invoice
        Delete the invoice in the Transactions window by choosing Delete Record from the Edit menu.
            This will delete the invoice and any lines.
        Void the invoice by changing the invoice's type in the Transaction window to a type with Open Receivables and Post to GL options set to No.
            This will delete the payment schedule and cancel distributions by removing the GL date.
        Reverse the distributions by creating a Credit Memo against the invoice.
        Delete the payment schedule by setting the Complete flag to No in the Transaction window.
            This will make the invoice inaccessible for payment or crediting.

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR) Notes on Transaction Entry and Changes (Transaction Workbench)
    Transaction Workbench
        BPA Icon to print invoices - see Bill Presentment Architecture
    The currency on transaction entry defaults from the batch currency
        If no batch currency is specified then currency defaults from the funtional currency for the associated set of books
    You cannot change an invoices (incomplete it) once it is posted to GL or has activity applied (receipts, adjustments, credits, deposits)
        Reference: Transaction Workbench: FAQ (Doc ID 220026.1)
        http://docs.oracle.com/cd/A60725_05/html/comnls/us/ar/maintn.htm#n_maint -- changes allowed to invoices
        http://oracleappsuserguide.blogspot.com/2009/02/maintaining-invoice-and-credit-memo.html#uds-search-results
    Customer Types on Transactions
        Sold-to - the customer on a quotation (quotations only require a Sold-to, not a Bill-to or Ship-to)
            Becomes the ship-to if a quotation is converted into an order
            A mandatory grouping element in auto-invoice for grouping orders onto invoices
            Sold-to appears on quotations but only ship-to and bill-to appears on standard invoices
            Also the customer on an order entered directly (ship-to or bill-to)
        Bill-to - the customer who's account is debited with the transaction
            Defaults from the Sold-to on orders unless there is a primary bill-to related customer and relationships are enabled
            Bill-to appears on the invoice
        Ship-to - the shipping address for the goods and services
            Defaults from the sold-to on orders if the sold-to is a ship-to customer
            Ship-to appears on the invoice
        Paying - defaults to bill-to customer, and used to identify the bank account for direct debit
            Can be changed after an invoice is complete
            Paying customer does not appear on the invoice

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR) Notes on Credits and Crediting a Transaction
    Types
        Credit Memos credit specific transactions
            Accounting on a credit memo copies the accounting from the transaction
        On-account Credits (do not credit a specific transaction)
            Accounting on on-account credits use auto-accounting rules and memo-line accounts
            On-account credits can be applied to an invoice in the Receipt Applications window
    Entering an On-Account Credit
        On-account credits are credits you assign to your customer's account that are not related to a specific invoice

    Deposits are prepayments for goods and services provided in the future
        Deposits create an invoice which the customer pays (as a prepayment)
        Each future invoice for goods and services references the deposit invoice
        The accounting clears the receivable of the future invoice (CR) and relieves the unearned revenue of the initial deposit (DR)

                Offset Account
                    If you set the 'AR: Deposit Offset Account Source' profile option to Transaction Type, 
                    then Receivables uses the Offset Account to derive the offset account for deposits. 
                    Otherwise, Receivables uses AutoAccounting to derive the deposit's offset account.

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Application Rule Sets
    Application Rule Sets determine how receipts are applied to the component charges within each ar invoice
        Components can include: Line items, Freight, Charges and Overapplication (and the taxes applicable to each of these line types)
    Application Rule Sets do not determine which invoices are settled, only the order of settlement within each transaction
    Seeded Application Rule Sets are assigned to Transaction Types and to System Options (Misc) as a default for the Operating Unit

    Autocash Rule Sets determine how cash is applied through AutoLockbox import or manually through QuickCash
        Both Locbox and Quickcash use the 'Post QuickCash' process which invokes AutoCash application processing
    'Automatic Matching Rules' are a new feature in R12 than can be used for both manual and lockbox receipts

    AutoLockBox automatically imports payment records from bank lockboxes
    The setup of AutoLockBox is justified for more than 2000-3000 customers
        Otherwise manual or QuickCash processing is more efficient

    Setups
        define the bank, branch and bank account
        Define Receipt Class for Auto Lockbox
        Define Receipt Source
        Define Autocash Ruleset
        Define Customer - Attach the receipt method and create the customer bank account (Branch number and account number together decides the MICR number)
        Define Lockbox (Setup --> Receipts --> Lockboxes --> Lockboxes)
        Define Transmission Formats (Setup --> Receipts --> Lockboxes --> Transmission Formats)
        Modify (or create a new one) the existing control file to suit the above formats
    AutoLockbox Process Steps
        1. Import (run AutoLockbox) - loads lockbox file into AR_PAYMENTS_INTERFACE_ALL - Payments Interface
            Lockbox Execution Report generated
        2. Validation (submit Validation) - validates imported receipts and loads into quickcash tables - Interim Cash Receipts
            AR_INTERIM_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL
            AR_INTERIM_CASH_RCPT_LINES_ALL
            Correct error data and revalidate - repeat multiple times
                Error Form uses AR_PAYMENTS_INTERFACE_V (join of ar_payments_interface i, ar_transmissions t, ar_trans_record_formats f, hz_cust_accounts c, hz_parties party)
            Creates a QuickCash batch
            Query and change data in the Quickcash window
        3. Post Quickcash (submit PostQuickcash) - creates real receipts, updates customer balances and loads into AR_CASH_RECEIPTS_ALL (receipts and applications)
            Submit Post Batch (PostBatch) concurrent program
               Generates Post QuickCash Execution Report
               Changes batch type from Manual-Quick to Manual-Regular
               Also updates

                    New: This transmission has been imported into Receivables but has not yet been validated.
                    Out of Balance: One or more of the receipts in this transmission was rejected during validation.
                    Open: All of the receipts in this transmission have been successfully validated and transferred into Receivables. Post QuickCash has not yet processed these receipts. 
                    Closed: All of the receipts in this transmission have been successfully processed by Post QuickCash. You can review these receipts in the Receipts window.
        Run Post QuickCash
            Program ARCABP 'Cash Application Batch Posting'
            View and edit and update (or delete) validated lockbox receipts in the Quickcash window (optional)

                    Will only find batches not posted (search on 'Manual-Regular' for imported batches)
            Creates receipt records in AR and removes records from the QuickCash tables
            Runs matching logic and AutoCash rules to apply receipts automatically to transactions
                Receipt matching logic during validation (before AutoCash) uses customer number and transaction number if provided
                    If the Customer Number is null, the MICR number is used if it is valid
                    Lockbox matches MICR using this code
                        SELECT bank_branch_id
                        FROM ap_bank_branches
                        WHERE ((bank_num = <Transit Routing Number> AND bank_number is null)
                        OR ( bank_name = <Transit Routing Number>
                        and bank_branch_name = <Transit Routing Number>));
                        bank_num = Transit Routing Number
                        bank_name = Transit Routing Number
                        bank_branch_name = Transit Routing Number
                    The association from a MICR to a customer number is stored in AP_BANK_ACCOUNT_USES
                    Uses customer billing location associations
                        Invokes Arlvbl.lpc. Validates billing location. First verifies that all specified billing locations are attached to the identified customers. 
                        If the lockbox requires a billing location and you do not pass a valid one, there must exist an active primary bill to site for the customer.
                    If no customer or transaction is provided during validation, auto-association rules is set to 'Yes' in Lockbox definition (Transactions tab)
                    Matching rules used by Auto-Association are taken from the customer site, customer or lockbox definition
                    'Match Receipts By' in the Lockbox Definition identifies what is passed in the file
                    Matching can be on transaction number, PO number, Billing Number or other rule entries
                If no match is made during validation, AutoCash rules are used to identify a match
                    Autocash matching uses the AutoCash rule set defined in the Profile Class for the Customer
                        One rule 'Match Payment with Invoice' is most often used
                        All rules are:
                            Match Payment with Invoice 
                            Clear the Account 
                            Clear Past Due Invoices 
                            Clear Past Due Invoices Grouped by Payment Term 
                            Apply to the Oldest Invoice First
                    If none is defined on the customer profile, uses the AutoCash rule set defined in AR System Options
                If there is no match, the receipt is created as 'Unidentified'
            Generates a 'Post QuickCash Execution Report'

            Bank Origination Number: The bank origination number of the bank that transmitted this lockbox file. Receivables determines the Bank Origination number from the remittance bank account you entered in the Lockboxes window. This field is in the Lockbox Control window.
            Control File: (Submit Lockbox Processing window) Receivables uses SQL *Loader to load information from your operating system files into the Receivables database.
                The control file is placed in the $AR_TOP/bin directory of the database server
                The control file is used by SQL *Loader to map the data in the bank file to tables and columns in the Oracle database. 
                You need to create a control file for each bank file that uses a different transmission format. 
                For SQL *Loader to load your bank file properly, each logical record that your bank sends to you must end with a carriage return. 
                If each record does not end with a carriage return, SQL *Loader displays an error message when you submit AutoLockbox.
                Suggestion: If you are using Receivables Multiple Organizations Support feature, we recommend that you create a different control file for each of your organizations. 
                Each control file should populate the default org_id column for that organization in the ar_payments_interface table. 
                Additionally, if your existing control files use the date format 'YY' for the year, we recommend that you change this to 'RR'. 
            Data File: The path name and the filename of the bank file you are transferring into Receivables. This is the file that contains payment data you receive from the bank. Receivables lets you store the file in any directory. This field is in the Submit Lockbox Processing window.
            Destination Account: (Lockbox Control window) The bank account into which this receipt was deposited.
            Item Number: (Lockbox Transmission Data window) The item number associated with this receipt. If you have multiple receipts in a batch, you might include this in your transmission format to order receipts in a batch.
            Lockbox Batch Count: (Lockbox Control window) The total number of bank batches associated with this lockbox.
            Lockbox Receipt Count: (Lockbox Control window) The total number of receipts associated with this lockbox. This count does not include overflow receipts, headers, or trailers.
            Overflow Sequence: (Lockbox Transmission Data window) A type of bank file record that stores additional receipt information that could not fit on the receipt record. Each Overflow record must have a receipt record as a parent. Typically, an Overflow record will store additional invoice numbers and the amount of the receipt to apply to each invoice. If there are multiple overflow records for a receipt record, each overflow record will have an overflow sequence.
            Record Count: (Lockbox Control window) The total number of records in this lockbox transmission.
            Record Identifier: (Lockbox Transmission Data window) A record identifier consists of at most two characters which Receivables uses to identify each record type. For example, Receivables can identify a receipt record in BAI bank files because this record always starts with the character '6'. You define valid record identifiers in the Transmission Formats window.
            Transmission Format: (Submit Lockbox Processing window) A transmission format defines what data your bank is sending in the bank file, and how that data is organized so Receivables can successfully import this data. You must work with your bank to determine the content of your transmission format. Your transmission format must match each bank control file that you create, so the number of control files that you use must correspond to the number of transmission formats that you define. Receivables provides two sample formats: 'CONVERT, (arconv.ctl)' and 'DEFAULT, (ardeft.ctl)'. You can modify these transmission formats or create new ones.

            If you have multiple customers whose invoices may be paid by a central location, but you have no separate customer set up as the "parent," you may want to set up a "dummy" customer as the parent. Assign the children to the parent using the Customers: Relationships Alternate Region and create the customer MICR record for the parent (using the Customers: Bank Accounts Alternate Region). Then the "parent" can pay the "children's" invoices within Lockbox and the other cash application forms


Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Refund Processing
    Background
        Refund processing for Receivables (e.g. return of deposit) is new in R12 (in 11i it required setting up a vendor and processing an invoice)
        Refunds can be applied to receipts (send the money back to the customer) or applied to on-account credit notes

    Overview
        A refund is entered on the receipt application screen along with other applications or in transaction workbench for a credit note (via Actions > Applications)
            A refund is its own activity type in activity setup
        A customer must be setup with a payment method on their account or saving a refund will throw an error
        Refunds create payments in AP which clear on the ledger through AP/AR clearing
            A refund credits AR Clearing as a liability
                The other side is the debit to cash for the payment received (part of the receipt is being refunded) or ...
                The other side is a debit to the receivables account for a credit note refunded
            The payables liability (mock invoice) debits AR Clearing and crebits AP Liability
            This leaves cash in the bank and an AP liability for future payment of the mock invoice
    Setup
        Create a Receivables Activity under Setup > Receipts > Activities for type 'Refund' before creating a refund in Receipts
        For automated sources (via AutoInvoice), update the Source definition 'Receipt Handling for Credits' to 'Refund'

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Consolidated Billing, Balance Forward Billing and Statement Billing
    Overview
        Balance Forward Billing (BFB) in R12 replaces Consolidated Billing in 11i
        Balance Forward Bills (BFB) include all transactions for a customer in a billing cycle plus the balance from the prior cycle
            The BFB includes all transactions, the opening balance, adjustments, posted receipts, debit and credit memos for the cycle
            In R12, bill consolidation can be at the Site level or Account Level (for a single operating unit)
                Account-level balance forward billing lets you generate one bill for each operating unit of the account, addressed to the primary bill-to site of the account. 
                Site-level balance forward billing lets you generate a balance forward bill for each bill-to site of a customer with multiple bill-to sites.
        Bills can be summarized or detail format
            Summary layout shows one line per invoice from the underlying invoice transaction
            Detail format shows one line per invoice line from the underlying invoice transaction
        Automatic receipts can be generated for BFB or manual receipts applied at the consolidated BFB level

        Bug 8495185 : BALANCE FORWARD BILL IS GENERATED EVEN IF CORRESPONDING INVOICE IS NOT ENTERED 
    Troubleshooting
        If no invoices are selected for billing
            Run a query to see if any draft bills need to be cancelled (new ones won't generate if there are)
                select * from ar_cons_inv_all;
            Check the billing terms on the customer and invoice (terms on the customer prevail if the invoice terms were changed)
            Check the billing date on the invoice and backdate if necessary
            Ensure the invoice header flexfield billing attribute is set to 'C'
            Check the invoices are completed
    R12 vs 11i Differences: Consolidated Billing Invoices (CBI in 11i) vs. Balance Forward Billing (BFB in R12)
        11i has Consolidated Billing Invoices (CBI)
        R12 has Balance Forward Billing or BFB  (which replaces consolidated billing)
            Proxima payment terms in 11i converted to Billing Cycles and Payment Terms in R12
                There is no entity 'Billing Cycle' in 11i
                The functionality in 11i is contained in the Proxima payment terms
                The Proxima data elements (e.g. Cutoff Date) in Proxima Payment Terms migrated to Billing Cycles in R12
        Bills in R12 can consolidate at Account or Site Level, but only Site Level in 11i
        Late Charges in R12 support Balance Forward Billing
        Invoices can be excluded from BFB cycles with 'DO NOT PRINT' option chosen, but all CBI invoices are selected if the customer site is CBI
        The View Document icon shows the BFB document, but shows the single invoice for CBI
        The Billing Date is dynamically calculated on BFB invoices but does not exist on CBI's
        Concurrent Processes
            BFB: Is controlled by 3 processes:
                Generate Balance Forward Bills (draft/final) - creates a draft bill for review (can be rolled back)
                Confirm Balance Forward Bills (accept/reject) - confirms the draft bill as final or rolls it back
                BPA Balance Forward Print Program - prints the confirmed bill
            CBI in 11i: Is/was controlled by 5 processes:
                Print Draft
                Accept
                Reject
                Print New

    External vs Recurring Billing Cycles
        Only recurring billing cycles can be setup in Balance Forward Billing Cycles
        External is a seeded value indicating invoices will be imported into AutoInvoice with a value in RA_INTERFACE_LINES_ALL.CONS_BILLING_NUMBER
            This means the consolidated billing number was derived externally before the invoices are imported
            The billing number must not yet exist where on the AR_CONS_INV_ALL table where CONS_INV_TYPE = 'MINV'
        External cycles are imported through AutoInvoice with the Consolidated Bill already prepared
        External is a seeded billing cycle name that can be chosen in Payment Terms to reference either a recurring cycle or 'external'

            Choose the cut-off dates - the day(s) on which the bill will be generated (can be one or multiple days within the cycle period)
            Choose the billing frequency (can be one or mulitple periods)
            Choose a Start Date that is not 10 years prior or a current date (e.g. back date one year), see MOS Note: 1052961.1
        Setup Payment Terms that Reference the Billing Cycle
            Navigation: AR Setup Responsibility > Setup > Transactions > Payment Terms
            Associate the Balance Forward Billing Cycle with the Payment Term
            Specify a Payment Schedule one month ahead so a monthly bill prints in the following month
            Specify the day in period the payment is due (some time after the Billing Date in the Billing Cycle definition)
                You can choose the Due Days, or the Due Day of Month an Months Ahead
        Enable the Customer Account for Balance Forward Billing
            Navigation: Customers > Customers > Query > Account Details > Account Profile > Balance Forward Billing

    You send accounting entries to GL using the General Ledger Tranfer Program (in 11i)
    In R12, run Submit Accounting or Create Accounting to generate GL entries
        Submit Accounting is a wrapper for Create Accounting which also runs Revenue Recognition
        Submit Accounting is an AR Application Process
        Create Accounting is an SLA Application Process which must be added to AR request groups

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Accounting Entries
    Enter a receipt as Unidentified Cash:
        DR Cash
        CR Unapplied Cash
    Post unapplied cash to an invoice
        DR Unapplied Cash
        CR Receivables
        CR Unidentified
    Apply an entered receipt to an account:
        DR Unapplied
        CR On-Account
    When your receipt includes a discount, Receivables creates the following journal entry:
        DR Cash
        CR Receivables
        DR Earned/Unearned Discount (expense)
        CR Receivables
    Receivables uses the default Cash, Unapplied, Unidentified, On-Account, Unearned,
        and Earned accounts that you specified in the Remittance Banks window for this receipt
        class.
    When you enter a receipt and combine it with an on-account credit (which increases the
        balance of the receipt), Receivables creates the following journal entry:
        DR Cash
        CR Unapplied Cash
    To close the receivable on the credit memo and increase the unapplied cash balance,
        Receivables creates the following journal entry:
        DR Receivables
        CR Unapplied Cash
    When you enter a receipt and combine it with a negative adjustment, Receivables
        creates the following journal entries:
        DR Cash
        CR Receivables (Invoice)
        DR Write-Off
        CR Receivables (Invoice)
    You set up a Write-Off account when defining your Receivables Activity.
        When you enter a receipt and combine it with a positive adjustment, Receivables creates
        the following journal entries:
        DR Cash
        CR Receivables (Invoice)
        DR Receivables (Invoice)
        CR Write-Off
    When you write off the unapplied amount on a receipt, Receivables creates the
        following journal entries:
      DR Unapplied Cash
      CR Write-off
    Receipt combined with a Chargeback
      DR Cash
      CR Receivables (Invoice)
      DR Receivables (Chargeback)
      CR Chargeback (Activity)
    You set up a Chargeback account when defining your Receivables Activity.
        To move funds between receipts, you can apply one receipt to another open receipt
        (also called netting receipts). For example, you can move funds from Receipt 1 to
        Receipt 2 by opening Receipt 2 in the Applications window, and selecting Receipt 1 in
        the Apply To field.
        See: Receipt-to-Receipt Applications, page 4-11.
    Following the example above, Receivables creates these journal entries:
        DR Unapplied Cash (Receipt 1)
        CR Netting (Receipt 1)
        DR Netting (Receipt 2)
        CR Unapplied Cash (Receipt 2)
    After this receipt-to-receipt application completes, Receipt 2 gains additional funds that
        you can then apply to a debit item.
        You set up a Netting account when defining your Receivables Activity.
        Important: When netting receipts, both receipts must be in the same
        currency.

        You can create customers in Order Managment directly when entering an order
        A customer is a party which has accounts - a customer is not an account

        System options must be fully configured or the Operating Unit LOV will be empty in customer setup as site level
        Most customer information is under the Addresses of the customer - go there first
        Customers, Accounts and Addresses are shared across operating units but a site at an address is OU specific
        You can reuse an address when you create a new account but you cannot create multiple sites for the same address within a single account

        Profile Option 'AR: Show Parties Without Accounts In DQM' Allows Supplier Parties to be Queried in Customer Maintenance to create Customer Accounts
    A Customer is a high level customer with an associated customer number
        An account is a separate entity below customer (party) to divide up customers for different commercial arrangements
            One account can be for industrial sales and another can be for consulting services
            Customer relationships (billing, contacts, aging) are managed at the account level
        A customer can have multiple accounts
        The same account can be used across multiple operating units (as can the addresses but not the sites at those addresses)
    The 'Location' on each business purpose at the site level is a shorthand word for the customer location (or account)
        Each business purpose has a different location name option
        You can enter these locations in transactions as a short hand reference to the customer address
        e.g. A ship-to location on an invoice has one shorthand word, a bill-to may have the same or another
        They tie back to the address of the site under which they are registered
    The Bill-to Location assigned to a Ship-to Location on a customer account site is restricted to a valid bill-to of the current customer or a related customer account

    Profile Classes should be decided before setting up Customers - see separate notes
    In Multi-Org customers are shared across all organizations but customer details are OPU specific
        OPU specific details include: addresses, business purposes, contacts and phones.
        Transactions with customers are also OPU specific and not visible to other OPU's
    Customers can have only one name and the name must be unique
        In Release 11i a customer can be identified as an organization or a person
            The person classification allows more specific attributes and associations (using TCA)
    Customers can have multiple accounts and customer attributes can be overridden at account level
    Customers can have multiple addresses and each address can have multiple business purposes
        One address can be used on multiple accounts with multiple purposes
    Customers comprise headers, payment methods, bank accounts, phones, addresses and relationships
    These attributes can be defined at the header level or address/site level
    Customers are setup in the RA_CUSTOMERS table
        This is now superceded by the HZ_CUST_ACCOUNTS table where the customer_id is now the cust_account_id
        HZ_CUST_ACCOUNTS has a foreign key to the HZ_PARTIES table

    Customer Relationships and Party Relationships are different
        Customer Relationships are stored in AR.HZ_CUST_ACCT_RELATE_ALL
        Party Relationships are stored in AR.HZ_RELATIONSHIPS
        Customer Relationships allow one customer to pay for another customers invoices
            Alternatively: set profile option "AR: Allow Payment of Unrelated Invoices" -- set to Yes to allow payments to be applied to other customers transactions

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on AutoAccounting Setup
    AutoAccounting derives each segment of the code combinations for AR Accounts including:
        Revenue - Income Statement account
        Receivables - Balance Sheet asset account
        Tax - Balance Sheet liability account
        AutoInvoice Clearing - Balance Sheet asset clearing account)
        Unearned Revenue
        Unbilled AR
    The primary drivers for AutoAccounting rules are:
        Transaction Types
        Sales Representatives
        Standard Memo Lines
        Tax Codes
        Customer Bill-To's
    In 11i Bill-To was added as a criteria to drive AutoAccounting
        Also in 11i Account Generator was introduced to derive the account segment for:
            foreign currency gains and losses
            interest charge calculations
        Other than these two areas, AutoAccounting derives all account code combinations
    The Transaction Flexfield uniquely identified imported invoice lines
        It is implemented as interface_line_attribute1 through ...attribute10 by Order Management

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Account Generator Setup
    Account Generator was introduced to Oracle AR in 11i
    It has a limited role generating account combinations for the following:
        Foreign currency gain/loss entries for currency conversion - balancing segment only
        Interest charge accounting - balancing segment only
    It replaces the role performed by Flexbuilder for these balancing segment values from Oracle 10
    This is a required setup even if the functions are not used
    All other accounting derivations are done by AutoAccounting in AR

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Profile Class Setup
    Profile classes create classifications of customers with similar characteristics:
        Credit worthiness
        Payment terms
        Cash receipt referencing
        Finance Charges
        Statements and Statement Cycles
        Dunning letters and rules
        Invoicing rules (actually no - these are defined on Order Types)
    Profile Classes provide defaults for customers and customer accounts
    Profile Classes can be overridden at the customer and account levels
        This may involve a lot of work if the number of customers is large

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Transaction Types
    References
        Setting Up Transaction Types In Oracle Receivables (Doc ID 1067797.1)
    Transaction Types default payment terms, accounts, taxability, freight, creation sign posting, and receivable information to transactions
    Transaction Types are stored in RA_CUST_TRX_TYPES_ALL and include some seeded values
        Credit Memo
        Debit Memo
        Invoice
        Projects Credit Memo
        Projects Invoice
    Each Transaction Type is classified as a member of a Class, including:
        Bills Receivable (e.g. promissory note)
        Chargeback
        Credit Memo
        Debit Memo
        Deposit
        Guarantee
        Invoice
    Transaction Types are Organization Specific and repeated for each organization
        Navigation: AR Superuser > Setup > Transactions > Transaction Types
    Transaction Type Definitions are:
        Chargeback - a transaction created and charged to a customer account for short-payment of an invoice
            Chargebacks are normally created during receipt application for short-paid invoices using the 'Chargeback' button on the applications form of Receipts Workbench
            A Chargeback is created with a new document number and default payment terms of immediate
            This is done via the 'Chargebacks' button when choosing transactions to apply against a receipt
    Transaction Type Options
        Allow Overapplication - can apply receipts for more than the transaction amount and drive the invoice balance negative
        Natural Application Only - receipts must reduce balance and not increase it
        Printing Option - controls whether invoices can be printed via Invoice Print

    Navigation: AR Superuser > Setup > Receipts > Receivable Activities
    Activities are receipt transactions which default accounting onto miscellaneous receipt transactions
        Define receivables activities to default accounting information for your miscellaneous receipt, finance charge, chargeback, and adjustment transactions
            They can be positive or negative
        The activities you define appear as list of values choices in the Receipt and Adjustment windows.
        You can define as many activities as you need.
        The accounting is assigned in the Activity definition
        The account is debited with the activity amount
            The corresponding credit is to the Receivables Asset Account (the customers' AR balance)
    There are several Activity Types and each activity is assigned one of these seeded Types when it is defined:
        Adjustment - used in the Adjustments window. At least one activity of type 'Adjustment' must be defined
        Bank Error - used in the Adjustments window and used to reconcile bank statements in Oracle Cash Management
        Earned Discount
        Endorsement
        Finance Charge
        Miscellaneous Cash
        Short Term Debt
        Unearned Discount
        Receipt Write-off
        Claim Investigation
        Credit Card Refund
        Prepayment - originating in Order Management and not enterable and an AR Receipt Application
        Payment Netting
        Credit Card Chargeback
        Refund
    Activities appear as LOV's in several Receivables windows
    Finance charge activity accounting is used on finance charges in statements and dunning letters
    Activities can be made innactive to remove them from LOV's, using the Active Flag on the Activity Definition form
    The GL Account Source field in the Activity Definition Form determines if the activity uses an Account Code or Distribution Set
        Distribution sets are not allowed on all activities

    Receivables lets you make either positive or negative adjustments to ..
        invoices, debit memos, chargebacks, on-account credits, deposits, and guarantees
    Adjustments are primarily write-offs
    Prerquisites for Adjustment Entry
        Define an Activity of Type Adjustment
        Define approval limits for the Adjustment
            Navigation: Receivables Manager > Transactions > Approval Limits
            Based on User Name and not employee - not OPU-specific
            When you enter an adjustment that is outside your approval limit range ...
                Receivables assigns the adjustment a status of Pending until someone with the appropriate approval limits either approves or rejects it.
        Define Reason QuickCodes for the Adjustment
            Navigation: Receivables Manager > Setup > System > Quickcodes > Receivables > Query (ADJUST_REASON)
        Set the profile option: AR: Cash  Allow Actions (hides or shows the Chargeback and Adjustments buttons on the Application window in Receipts Workbench)
    Steps to Record an Adjustment in the Receipts Workbench
        Navigate to the Receipts Form
        Enter a new receipt or query an existing receipt
        Choose Applications and select the transactions to apply to the receipt
        Click the 'Adjustments' button on the Applications page (note: it may be hidden through profile option: 'AR: Cash  Allow Actions')
        Enter an Activity Name and select the type of adjustment: invoice, line, charges, freight or tax
            The Type allows the adjustment to be applied to a specific component of the transaction
        Save the work - Oracle generates a unique number for the adjustment
        You can also enter an adjustment directly against a transaction from the Transaction Summary Form
    Adjustments can also be recorded directly against transactions in the Transaction Summary Form
        Query a transaction
        Navigate: Menu > Actions > Adjust
        Enter an adjustment
    Approving Adjustments
        Navigation: Receivables Manager > Control > Adjustments > Approve Adjustments
    Bad Debt
        Set up an adjustment activity 'Bad Debt' that charges the bad debt account
        Enter the bad debt as an invoice adjustment either directly or through receipt application
    Auto Adjustments (AutoAdjustments)
        Navigation: Receivables Manager > Control > Adjustments > Create AutoAdjustments
        Allows for creating adjustments on a large number of invoices
        Set profile optoin AR: INVOICES WITH UNCONFIRMED RECEIPTS = 'None' or concurrent program will end in error

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Receipt Classes and Receipt Methods
    References
        How to Restrict the Transaction Sources And Receipts Methods List of Values to One Operating Unit Only (Doc ID 783733.1)
    A Receipt Class is defined with one or more receipt methods
        A Receipt Class defines the processing steps for automatic or manual receipts (the Creation Method, Remittance Method and Clearance Method)
        The Receipt Class Creation Method (Automatic, Manual, Factoring etc) Drives the Region for entering Receipt Methods
    A Receipt Method defines the bank account and the GL accounting for the receipts
        Accounting includes the bank cash account and the unapplied, on account receipts and discount accounts
        Each Receipt Method is assigned a Payment Method which is assigned on the AR Invoice
        You must assign a Bank Account to a Receipt Method
            Receipt Classes and Methods are Global
            The Bank Account assigned to the Receipt Class enables Receipt Methods in LOV's because it determines the OU (e.g in the AR Transactions form)

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Receipt Sources
    Navigation: Receivables Manager > Setup > Receipts > Sources
        Navigation: Receivables Manager > Setup > Receipts > Sources
    Receipt Sources control automatic and manual batch numbering on receipts
        The current batch number can be reset at any time (last number used)
            If multiple receipt sources are used, batch starting numbers need to be spaced to avoid overlap
        Sources can be manual (received outside or automatic (generated)

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Distribution Sets Setup
    Navigation: AR Superuser > Setup > Receipts > Distribution Sets
    Distribution sets used on miscellaneous receipt transactions (non-invoice related receipts)
    They attach account distributions to the transaction
    These receipts can include:
        refunds,
        revenue from the sale of stock,
        interest
        investment income.
    Distribution sets are predefined groups of general ledger accounting codes
        They determine the credit accounts for positive miscellaneous receipt amounts
        They determine the debit accounts for negative receipt amounts.
    Distribution sets reduce time spent on data entry.
    You can also use distribution sets to apply percentages of other receipts to different accounts.
    You can have an unlimited number of distribution set lines in one set.
    The total distribution lines must equal 100% before you can save your distribution set.
    Receivables displays active distribution sets as LOV's in two forms:
        Transactions
        Receivables Activities

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Multi-Fund Accounting
    References
        http://oracleapplicationsimplmentation.blogspot.com/2009/06/r12-multi-fund-invoice-accrual.html -- example using memo lines
    A fund is a source of money (funding)
        Each fund may have a different purpose and reporting requirement
    Allows posting invoices and receipts to multiple balancing segments
    Individual transactions can post to multiple funds or balancing segments
    The balancing segment on the AR invoice for the AR account is derived from the balancing segment on the sales credit one of two ways
        Account Method - the balancing segment and all other segments except the natural account are copied
        Balancing Method - only the balancing segment is copied
        Both the Account and Balancing Methods are seeded Journal Line Definitions in SLA that must be assigned to a custom/copy Application Accounting Definition
    The balancing segment on the receipt is derived from the corresponding sale
        Create accounting must be run on the invoice before the receipt is created

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Customer Import Interface
    Customer Interface
        Used to import current or historical customer information into Receivables
        The program that imports data from the staging tables to AR is "Customer Interface"
            The program validates the data prior to import, and subsequently imports the records.
        Staging tables include:
            RA_CONTACT_PHONES_INTERFACE
            RA_CUSTOMERS_INTERFACE - stores customers, addresses and business purpose information
            RA_CUSTOMER_PROFILES_INTERFACE
            RA_CUSTOMER_BANKS_INTERFACE
            RA_CUST_PAY_METHOD_INTERFACE
        It has two modes: insert and update
            Update allows importing additional addresses or updating existing customer information
            The field INSERT_UPDATE_FLAG ("U" or "I"is a required field on the following interface tables:
                RA_CUSTOMERS_INTERFACE
                RA_CONTACT_PHONES_INTERFACE
                RA_CUSTOMER_PROFILES_INTERFACE
            Update mode cannot be used on DFF's (i.e. ATTRIBUTE fields) for CUSTOMER, SITE_USE and ADDRESS
        A report is produced by the interface "Customer Interface Transfer Report" with three sections
            Summary of the process run
            Statistics of tables updated
            Error messages for rejected records.

            How Does The Invoice Date Get Derived From The Sales Order Line? (Doc ID 300311.1)
        AutoInvoice is a standard API process for importing invoices
            These are typically from an Order Management System
            The program runs as 'AutoInvoice Master Program'
                The program has a 'Number of Instances' parameter which sets the number of parallel processes (on separate CPU's)
                    Formula to use is Number of Instances = Number of CPU's - 1 (for maximum throughput)
                This parameter works in conjunction with other profile setting including
                    Profile Option: "AR: Maximum Lines Per AutoInvoice Worker"
                    AutoInvoice Parameter: "Organization" - All or one specific organization (feature available in R12 only)
                    AutoInvoice Parameter: "Number of Parallel Workers" - Maximum number of workers, this value can be overridden by AutoInvoice for performance reasons.

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Revenue Recognition
    Tip
        You must run Revenue Recognition from the AR menu before running Create Accounting, or
        Run Create Accounting online, which submits Revenue Recognition automatically as a pre-step

        Error: Please Define All Periods In Which Revenue Is To Be Recognized Or Credited (AutoInvoice and Transaction Workbench) (Doc ID 455691.1) 
    In R12 ... Revenue Recognition Based on Rules and Events
        Time Based: Ratably over time or upon expiration of contingencies
        Event Based: upon payment or customer acceptance
        Rule Based: payment term thresholds, refund policy thresholds and customer credit worthiness
    In R12, run Submit Accounting or Create Accounting to generate GL entries
        Submit Accounting is a wrapper for Create Accounting which also runs Revenue Recognition
        Submit Accounting is an AR Application Process
        Create Accounting is an SLA Application Process which must be added to AR request groups
    Business Rules for Revenue Recognition
        For sale of finished goods (Inventory Items), revenue is recognized at the date of sale (some interpret this as the date of shipping or the date of delivery)
        For sale of services (e.g. support services), revenue is recognized when the services are performed (delivered)
        For sale of Asset Items (other than inventory items like finished goods), revenue is recognized at the point of sale (i.e. when the customer is invoiced)
        For revenue from other activities like rent for using company's Fixed Assets, revenue is recognized as time passes or as assets are used
    Accounting
        Initial Invoicing
            DR Receivables
            CR Deferred Revenue Revenue Recognized (products or services delivered or used)
            DR Deferred Revenue (for fractional amount earned)
            CR Revenue/Sales (for fractional amount earned)
        GL Dates on Entries for Invoicing Rule 'In Arrears'
            The GL Date for Receivables is moved to the last period in the accounting rule
            The GL Date in the last period is the same number of days from the start of the period as the original GL date before it was moved (the entered GL date)
                This GL date applies to the revenue deferral entries also, in each deferral period, is the same number of days after the start of each period as the original date
    Setups in Oracle
            You can assign a different accounting rule to each invoice line
            Accounting rules specify the percentage of revenue recognized in each period
        Define Accounting Rules
            Navigation: AR SuperUser > Setup > Transactions > Accounting Rules
            Enter a rule name and period type, and number of periods
            Check 'Deferred Revenue' to account for all revenue as deferred
                If this feature is enabled, the Revenue Accounting Wizard (RAM) must be run later to recognize the revenue in each period
            Enter a percentage amount to recognize in each period
        Assign Accounting Rules to Billable Items
            Navigation: AR Superuser > Setup > Items > Define Items > (Query Item) > Invoicing Tab > Accounting Rule
        Recognize Deferred Revenue
            Only applies to revenue recognized in advance (invoicing rule in advance)

        https://blogs.oracle.com/ebs/resolving-autoinvoice-date-issues
    Invoicing Rules are used to determine when the Receivable is Recognized for invoices spanning multiple accounting periods
    Accounting Rules determine when the revenue is recognized
    You can only assign one invoicing rule per invoice
    There are only two seeded invoicing rules (you cannot define additional rules) which are:
        Invoice in Advance
            AR is debited when the first revenue recognition period happens
        Invoice in Arrears
            Unbilled AR is debited when the first revenue recognition period happens
            Unbilled AR is credited and AR is debited when the final revenue recognition period happens
    Invoicing Rules apply to accrual accounting and not cash accounting
    Invoicing Rules determine when the AR Receivable is recognized
        They are separate to Accounting Rules which determine when the Sale is recognized (revenue recognition)
    Invoicing and Accounting Rules are defaulted from Order Types (Order Transaction Types - header and line levels) or Inventory Items (Invoicing tab) or entered manually on invoices
        They are not defaulted from Customer Profile Classes or Invoice Types

Accounts Receivable (RA and AR Schema) Notes on Concurrent Processes
    Run General Ledger Interface Program (ARGLTP) - posts journals to the GL
    You can submit directly as 'General Ledger Transfer Program'
    You can submit it from the menu under AR Responsibility -> Interfaces -> General Ledger
        If you submit with the option to import journals and there are no journals the import program will throw a warning
        There is no option to disable journal import if no journals are created
    Program 'General Ledger Transfer Program' kick off additional jobs:

Advanced Pricing (QP) Notes on General Functionality:
    Advanced Pricing is a general pricing engine that can be called by multiple modules;
        Order Management
        Procurement
        Customer Relationship Management
    The primary entities in advanced pricing include:
        Qualifiers and Qualifier Groups - determine who is eligible for price lists and modifiers (discounts)
            Used in eligibility rules linked to price lists and modifiers
            A number of qualifiers are seeded
            Examples include: Customer, Bill-to, Sales Channel, Order Type, Line Type, Shipment Date, Shipping Method, Payment Terms, Freight Terms, etc
        Modifiers - discounts and incentives
    Price Lists
        Price lists contain item and item category prices
        Price lists can have one of the following pricing types (or methods)
            Fixed price
            Formula price (price based on another price list and arithmatic operators)
            Percentage price - a price expressed as a percentage of another item
            Price breaks (or pricing tiers) - prices based on volume ranges
        There are primary and secondary price lists
            If an item cannot be found on a primary price list, it is searched on secondary price lists
            Each price list can have one or more secondary price lists
            Secondary price lists have precedence values - the lowest value precedence is checked first.
        Price Lists can be built as a percentage of other price lists
        Price lists can be maintained by mass update to propagate the same price change across multiple lists

Advanced Product Catalog (APC) Notes
    APC centralizes product and component information through out Oracle applictions into a central repository - including products, components, services and assets
    Provides a master index to BOM's, document specifications, change requests, and change orders
    Catalog categories can be structured hierarchically with three characteristic types: attributes, custom functions and lifecycles.
    These catalog structures can be browsed interactively with each category showing their contents.
    Attributes can be unlimited and have units of measure associated with them
    Functions can be associated with catalog categories and presented to users as dynamically rendered buttons on forms when the items are displayed
    Access security is based on roles which restrict access by organization, category or individual item
    Each role defines actions that can be performed on an item or category
    Each attribute group can be secured with a role privilege to restrict access to information at the attribute level
    Searches can be simple string or parametric (contains, starts with, ends with) and can be stored for reuse
    Searches can be associated with display formats for presenting the results of the search or filtering results.
    Searches can be: exact match, inexact match, word positioning, associative match, boolean, and stemming
    A search index is built using the concurrent program: 'Item Catalog Text Index Build' - this must be run by a person with Development Responsibility
    You can compare items side by side resulting from a catalog search
    Lifecycle tracking uses association to a project to move a product through different stages as the project progresses
    Attachments can be associated to individual items
    Items and attributes and item roles can be imported through a standard API (item-roles update security role associations with items)
    Item attributes can be imported for items
    Stucture types can be set up to classify the structure of an item. Structure types include: Engineering BOM, Manufacturing BOM and Service BOM.
    Hierarchies can be setup for structure types so that Electrical BOM's, Mechanical BOM's will inherit the attributes of the Engineering BOMs.
    Change categories can be setup to capture changes to items. Categories include: original issue, change request, change order etc)
    User defined attributes can be attached to changes, such as cost information

Advanced Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) Best Practices:
    Global sourcing rules for centralized procurement

Advanced Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) Notes on General Functionality:
    ASCP introduced with Oracle 11. SCP was available in version 10.7 - ASCP produces an cost plan given various constraints
    Optimization goals are max profit, max on-time delivery and max inventory turns
    ASCP output publishes back to each participating Oracle instance and organization: order releases, reschedules and cancellations.
    ASCP produces a plan for multiple inventory organizations, multiple time periods, multiple plan types and multiple manufacturing methods (holistic planning)
    ASCP plans using input from multiple Oracle instances and from non-Oracle applications
    Finite planning is constraint based (not 'infinite') planning including: material and supplier capacity, manufacturing capacity, transport capacity constraints
    Plan types supported by ASCP are: Distribution Plan (like a DRP), Production Schedule (like an MPS) and Manufacturing Plan (like an MRP)
    An MPS is the same data structure as an MDS but netted for existing inventories.
        An MPS is a high level plan of finished goods items to make (high level demand) and when they can be made
        It is based on manufacturing capacity.
    The Planner Workbench in ASCP supports KPI's:
        Inventory Turns,
        On-Time Delivery,
        Margin %,
        Margin Value,
        Resource Utilization, and
        Cost Breakdown.
    KPI targets can be set in BIS for reporting against, in the ASCP Planner Workbench.
    ASCP runs on a separate server for performance reasons.
        This also facilitates collection of planning base data from multiple instances
    Basic supply chain modeling is done with standard setups:
        item make or buy attribute,
        item source organization and subinventory.
    Multi-org planning must identify the organizations included in the plan from each instance of the applications
    Supply sourcing is modeled with sourcing rules, bills of distribution and assignment sets
    Sourcing rules are planned sources of supply
        They can be global to all inventory organizations within an Operating Unitor local to a single organization
        Sourcing options include:
            make within the org,
            buy from an outside supplier, or
            transfer from another org (as limited by delivery networks)
        Priority codes and percent splits define which sourcing options are considered first (highest priorities)
        Priority codes also establish how sources are split (eg between suppliers)
    Sourcing is defined by a sourcing rule or bill of distribution (supplier rules), linked to a distribution set (item rules)
    Sourcing rules and bills of distribution can be global (all inv orgs) or local to a single inventory organization
    A Bill of Distribution is a collection of sourcing rules
        It is used where the same sourcing rules apply to multiple organizations.
        Bills are local to their named orgs
    Assignment Sets specify items for sourcing rules
        Assignment Sets can be done for specific categories, items or org restrictions.
        Multiple sets are allowed for different purposes like planning, or simulation.
    One assignment set is specified in the planning options for a single plan
        So an assignment set should cover all items/orgs for a specific plan
    Several assignments can be valid for a single item (item specific, category specific and org specific).
        The lowest level rule takes precedence.
    Aggregate resources in a plan are supported by defining a resource as aggregate type
        and grouping all resources in a department to the aggregate resource
    Supplier capacity constraints are specified in approved supplier (ASL) list attributes
    Penalty factors are stored in descriptive flexfields
        that are created by running the concurrent program: 'Create Planning Flexfields'
        Penalty factors are entered in the Plan Options window, on the 'optimization' tab
        Penalty factors escalate the costs of resources for overuse (eg overtime costs) as input to cost/margin optimization.
        Late delivery penalty is a fraction of the item value, per day late
    Explicit objectives can be set/weighted for:
        inventory turns,
        plan profit,
        on-time delivery (on the Optmization tab of the Plan Options form)
    Implicit objectives always optimized in ASCP are minimum:
        late demand,
        resource exceptions,
        safety-stock violations,
        alternate resources,
        alternate routings,
        inventory carrying cost
    Lot for Lot planning ensures each demand generates a separate plan order to mfg
         It is not consolidated to a single order.
         Set with the Lot for Lot option on the Plan Options window
    Plan options allow specification of actual route scheduling for plan orders in the 'daily bucket' portion of the plan - see 'plan options' form
    Run the 'Planning Data Collection' request set to kick off data collection
        (request set - includes planning data pull and planning ODS load)
    Results of the plan are viewed on the ASCP Planner Workbench.
        Work orders can be released from the workbench.
    Planned orders can be firmed, rescheduled, or added to, via the Supply/Demand form
        after the plan has been run (release from the PLan menu option)
    Plans can be copied to save, and then rerun in multiple simulations.
        Use the Plan menu item, and the Copy selection.
    The seeded workflows in ASCP are all exception based notifications and only generate from a plan named 'PRODUCTION'

Advanced Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) Responsibilities:
    ADVANCED SUPPLY CHAIN PLANNNER

Advanced Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) Setup:
    Overall - define supply chain, create flexfields, define instances and DB links,
        name a plan, demand priority rules, plan names and options
    Define planning descriptive flexfields that store penalty factors for implicit objectives:
        run 'Create Planning Flexfields' concurrent program and set parameters to define structures
    Define instances to collect data, on the 'Application Instances' form
    Name a plan in the Supply Chain Plan Names form
    Create named priority rules and set the priority criteria within each rule.
        A priority rule default is required for a plan. Use the 'Define Priority Rules' form
    Create a named plan and set the planning options for the named plan on the Plan Options form

Advanced Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) Profile Options:
    MSO: Inventory Carrying Costs Percentage
        average percent of item value that is carrying cost for optimization calcs. Can be overridden at the item level
    MRP: Plan Revenue Price List, and MRP: Plan Revenue Discount Percent
        used to calculate revenue for margin optimization on forecast demand (not on sales orders where actual prices are used)
    MSO: Penalty Cost Factor for Late Demands
        establishes the penalty fraction per item per day for late deliveries.

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Troubleshooting, Tips and Tricks:
    Avoid duplicates on summary alerts by using :DATE_LAST_CHECKED in the Where clause (a self referencing alert)
        Formatting the date is required otherwise an error will be thrown
        e.g. WHERE TO_DATE(creation_date, 'DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI:SS') > TO_DATE(:DATE_LAST_CHECKED, 'DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI:SS')
    You won't see history in Alert Check if there is no retention to 'Keep x Days' in the Alert definition
    Test a Periodic Alert to verify it is working by running Alert Check
        If the Alert is disabled (Enabled box unchecked) it is not runnable from the Alert Check process
        On the Alert Manager menu, choose 'Request' > 'Check' and run the Alert
        Initially Set the Alert Option to Keep History for 7 Days so you can view the Actions from the Alert
            If you don't set this option, action history will be blank and unavailable for debugging
        After running the Alert, review the results and Actions of an Alert via Alert History
            Navigation is Alert Manager -> History -> (Query Alert) -> 'Find Checks' or 'Find Exceptions' or 'Find Actions'
                'Find Checks' finds each execution of the Alert Check process for an alert
                'Find Exceptions' displays the values of output variables from each run of the Alert
                'Find Actions'
        The 'Verify' button on the Alert Definition form parses the SQL but does not run it
        The 'Run' button on the Alert Definition runs the SQL but does not invoke any actions
            Running from this button will not create output - you must run the Alert Check process
        Duplicate checking won't work if Alert history is set to zero
    For 11.5.10.2 RUP4 and above, Alert uses Workflow Mailer and not Unix Sendmail
        Mails will not go out if Workflow Notification Mailer is disabled
            Mails will queue up in WF_NOFIICATION_OUT and can be seen with a query
                select * from wf_notification_out;
            To see if the Notification Mailer is disabled, run
                SELECT COMPONENT_STATUS from APPS.FND_SVC_COMPONENTS where COMPONENT_ID=10006;
    Add SQL*Plus format masks to output variables using a "#" pound sign delimiter
        e.g. &QTY#999999 formats the number as six digits with no decimals
        e.g. &LNAME#A15 formats the string as 15 characters
    Set the value of an input variable in SQL through the Alert Input Form
        Navigation: Alerts -> (Query Alert) -> Alert Details -> Inputs (tab)
    Pass an input variable to an output variable, select the input into the output
        e.g. Select name, :INVAR into &NAME, &INVAR from table
            This passes :INVAR into &INVAR for formatting into the action output
    Event Alerts cannot take before and after pictures of what changed
        This is because they fire after insert or after update - not before
    Debug the Alert SQL SELECT statement in SQL*PLUS before importing it into the Alert for further testing
    Avoid Event Alerts because they are resource intensive and fire every time a table is updated
        Use Periodic Alerts instead
    Define one Concurrent Manager to run the ALECTC processes
        ALECTC is the Alert concurrent request (Alert Event Check)
        exclude ALECTC from other concurrent managers to optimize performance
        Note that ALECDC is the equivalent concurrent process for periodic alerts
    You can delete an Alert if there is no enabled action set, or action history

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Profile Options:

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Terminology:
    Action Set - a collection of one or more defined actions
        Action Sets are tied to Alerts and Actions within an Action Set are processed with the Alert
        This allows multiple Actions to be performed in sequence (by grouping under an action set)
            However it creates an uneeded wrapper layer if only one action is required
    Alert Check - the process of running an alert (either ALETC for event or ALECDC for periodic)
        This is run from the Alert Manager window and executes the Alert and related actions
    Alert Exception - a single row returned by the Alert SQL script when the Alert fires

Alerts (ALR Schema) Notes on Responsibilities:
    Alert Manager (AM) - this is the only seeded Alert responsibility

Alerts (ALR Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    Alerts trigger actions such as emails or execution of scripts or concurrent programs
    There are two types of alerts:
        A Periodic Alert is a Select query that runs on a schedule and performs an action for each line returned
        Periodic Alerts fired by a clock (concurrent schedule), and
            Periodic Alerts perform actions based on a set schedule or On Demand
            On Demand firing requires a user to request the Alert to run via the 'Alert Check' process
        Rows returned by a Periodic Alert Statement indicate a condition has been met
            An action is performed if the condition is met (i.e. one or more rows are returned)
        Event Alerts fired by an event such as a database event (row insert, update, but not delete).
            An Event Alert is a Select query that fires on a database trigger and performs an action for each line returned
            Event Alerts are basically triggers - they are based on a non-periodic event
            Triggers include insert or update actions on a record in a table
                Delete actions are not tracked by Event Alerts
    Input variables can be defined for an Alert with ":" notation (e.g. ":MY_VAR")
        There are several implicit variables defined automatically by Alert: ":ROWID", ":MAILID", ":DATE_LAST_CHECKED"
        These can be used in the Alert
    Output variables can be defined for an Alert with "&" notation (e.g. "&OUT_VAR") and included in email templates
    The Select Query in an Alert cannot be an update or insert - it must be a select
    Updates must be defined as Actions or in PL/SQL Packages 'selected' by an SQL statement
    Alerts maintain a history of previous alert runs to enable checking of repeated alert events
    Alert History also supports auditing of exceptions
    Response processing parses email responses from users for follow up actions
    Actions must be wrapped into Action Sets to tie to an alert - even singular actions require an action set wrapper
        Event alerts cannot capture before/after pictures - they only fire after insert or update
    Oracle Applications ship with a number of precoded Event Alerts for DBA and Alert management
        These precoded alerts are embedded in the applications
    Alerts are defined under individual applications (they must be named uniquely within an application)
        The application is used to determine the Oracle ID used to log onto the system when the alert is run.
        It establishes privileges for the alert
    Alert exceptions are found by executing an SQL SELECT script when the event (or periodic schedule) occurs:
        each row returned by the SELECT script is an exception
        Multiple exceptions (return lines from the SQL statement) can be evaluated for a single outcome or
            grouping of outcomes (summary action) with a threshhold
    Alert actions can be: SQL scripts, Operating System scripts, email, or concurrent requests
        Alert actions have levels:
            Detail (one action for every line returned by the SELECT statement,
            Summary (one action for all lines returned by the SELECT statement)
            No Exception (one action defined if there is no exception found)
                You can use this level to send an alert if no exception if found
    Alerts has an interface with email for outbound notifications and inbound responses
        emails are the most common actions taken by alerts
        Mail distributions can be downloaded from 'mailto' tables for dynamic routing
    Response processing in alerts handles responses to alerts made by users.
        Response processing can trigger actions just as alerts trigger actions

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Defining an Alert
    Exercise: Define an Event Alert
        1. Define the Alert -> <Alert Manager>/Alert/Define
            Name the Alert and it's Application (names must be unique within application)
                The Alert Application is used for a namespace
                The Alert Application also gives the Alert its database credentials
            Check or uncheck the Enabled check box to activate or suspend the Alert
                If the Alert is disabled it is not runnable from the Alert Check process
            Choose the Periodic Alternate Region or Event Alternate Region
                If the Periodic Alternate Region is chosen
                    Set the schedule for the Alert or choose "On Demand"
                If the Event Alternate Region is chosen
                    Choose the table the Alert will trigger from (Application and Tablename)
                        The Application for the table can be different to the Alert Application
                        The table must be registered with the Oracle Applications Library
                    Set the trigger mode as Insert or Update
                        Check both boxes to fire the Alert on both modes
            Enter the SQL Select Statement
                The statement must contain an Into clause
                    The Into Clause must have one output variable for each column selected
                    Output variables are designatd with a leading "&" ampersand
        2. Create Alert Details -> <Alert Manager>/Alert/Define/(Query the Alert)/Details
        3. Define Actions -> <Alert Manager>/Alert/Define/(Query the Alert)/Actions
        4. Define an Action Set -> <Alert Manager>/Alert/Define/(Query the Alert)/Action Set

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Message Actions:
    Message actions are based on user responses to an alert
        Actions can respond to parameter values in the response
    Followup actions are defined to trigger if no response is received in a set time period
    Alerts can make efficient substitutes to developing custom reports
    Alert history is maintained and can be reviewed.
        Alert history is needed if duplicate alert supression is needed
    The event table for an event alert is the table on which the alert sets the trigger
        This trigger is set to fire and execute the Alert SQL SELECT statement
    Output variables are defined with a leading '&', populated from the SELECT statement in the alert
    Input variables are defined with a leading ':', and used as parameters in the SELECT statement in the alert
    Implicit inputs supplied by Alert to the SELECT are :ROWID, :MAILID and :DATE_LAST_CHECKED
        :ROWID is used to identify the row that triggered the event
            It is internally assigned by Alert logic from the trigger that set off the event
        :MAILID is the mail address of the application user
            It defaults to the user name or operating system user id if the mail address is not setup in the user profile
        :DATE_LAST_CHECKED is set internally by Alerts to the date of the last event for the alert.
            It can be used in the SELECT to limit the query

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Internal Architecture:
    There are three concurrent programs that run alerts:
        ALEPPE - Periodic Alert Scheduler (finds periodic alerts to schedule the next day)
        ALECDC - Check Periodic Alert (scheduled by ALEPPE for each periodic alert each day)
        ALECTC - Check Event Alert (fired by a database trigger)
    For event alerts, a database event (trigger) submits the concurrent alert program
        The program (ALECTC - Check Event Alert) receives the name of the Alert as a parameter
            It runs the SQL Select statement defined in the Alert.
        ALECTC processes the SELECT statement in the alert to identify a condition
            If a condition is met (i.e. row returned) ALECTC executes the Alert action
    For periodic alerts, a concurrent program runs every 24 hours (ALEPPE - Periodic Alert Scheduler)
        ALEPPE creates a separate scheduled instance of "ALECDC - Check Periodic Alert" for each periodic alert
            Only those periodic alerts with schedules pending in the next 24 hours are scheduled
            ALEPPE searches (and creates a schedule) for all upcoming Periodic Alerts in the next day
        Each scheduled ALECDC starts the SELECT clause in the Alert to test for any returned rows.
            ALECDC executes the Alert Action if the condition is found true (one or more rows are returned)
    For concurrent program actions, output parameters can be specified in the alert definition.
        Multiple parameters are separated by a space. Constants must be quoted
    For email message alerts, distribution lists can be setup and used in address fields.
        Multiple email ID's are comma separated.
        The email server address is the 'replyto' address in the setup form for email message actions
    For email alerts requiring automated response processing,
        a response set must be defined and referenced (response set includes response text and valid values)
    Message text for notification emails can be imported by choosing 'File' and entering the file path as a variable name
        or entered directly as text. Message maximum length is 2000 characters
    Output variables ('&var's) can be inserted in the message text that goes with the email notification
        (eg '... your journal &HEADER_NAME for ...')
    Exercise: Create a message alert distribution list: AM/Distribution List, and specify mail-to recipients
    The Application associated with an Alert Definition determines the database authority it runs under

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Actions:
    Define by clicking the 'Actions' button on the Define Alerts form
        Name each action and it's type/level: detail, summary, no-exception.
    Define the details for each action by clicking on the 'Details' button on the Actions form.
        Choose one of four responses: message, concurrent program, SQL script or operating system script
    Action type = Message sends an email to a list of recipients for each row returned by the SELECT statement
    If a Summary Action is chosen for a message action type -
        one message is sent for each unique combination of output variables
        there is one row in the message for each row returned by the SELECT statement
    Action type = Concurrent program lets you choose a concurrent program and specify the parameters
    If a Summary Action is chosen for a concurrent program action type
        the concurrent program executes once for every unique combination of arguments returned by the SQL script
    Action type = Operating System Script lets you name a script
        (or an Oracle App and script - Alerts uses the BIN subdirectory to look for the script) to execute.
        Separate parameters with a space.
    If a summary action is chosed for an operating system action type -
        the operating system script is executed once for each unique combination of values returned by the SELECT statement in the alert
    You can type in a script directly instead of referencing an external file name.
        This allows you to embed output variables in the script.
    Action type = SQL Statment Script.
        Each statement must end with a ';' or '/' to work.
        If an application is specified, the SQL filename must be in the /sql subdirectory under the application top.
        Output variables '&...' can be used as filenames to point to the SQL file
    If a 'No Exception' action level is chosen -
        you cannot reference any output variables in the action definition
        the output variables will be NULL - the SELECT statement will return no lines

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Escalated Actions and Duplicate Suppression
    Trick
        You have to check the Alert Output in Alert Check to see if Duplicate Suppression is Working
            Alert Check will show notifications created even though duplicate suppression is turned on
            The Suppression is in the output file - and shows if the emails were actually sent
            It is also a good idea to check actual email output in a mail account to see if suppression is working
    You must use an Escalation Group to use Duplicate Suppression
        Duplicate Suppression prevents the same message being sent out twice within the History Retention period
        To enable Duplicate Suppression
            Define an Escalation Group for the Alert (from the Tools menu)
            Include the Alert Action in the Escalation Group
            Include the Escalation Group in the Alert Action Set (don't include the Alert Action)
            Enable the Duplicate Suppression Flag on the Action Set and individual Action Set output members
            Set the Alert History Retention to a non-zero value
            Run the Alert twice - first to establish an Alert History and then to check duplicate suppression
    Escalating alerts allow new alerts if an exception condition remains uncleared.
        It requires escalation history be active for the alert
    Escalating alert actions are defined in escalation groups
        Each action in an escalation group must have the same action level (summary, detail, no exception)
    Individual actions in an escalation group are escalated based on level
        Level is lowest to highest and can be checkmarked as disabled, or end dated.
    Exercise: Define an Escalation Group -> AM/Alert/Define and choose Escalation Groups from the Tools menu
        to define an escalation group and attach individual actions and define the escalation level for each action

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Summary Threshold Groups:
    Summary threshold groups are action groups that combine a detailed action and summary action.
        The detail action is triggered unless ...
            the number of exceptions reaches a threshold
            in which event the summary action is triggered to summarize the larger number of exceptions
    Exercise: Define a Summary Threshold Group -> AM/Alert/Define and choose Threshold Group from the Tools Menu.
        Select a summary and detail action with the same action type (eg message, or SQL script)

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Action Sets:
    Multiple actions can be defined for a single alert
        Action sets decide the order of execution, what to do if the action fails, and threshold levels for threshold groups
    Multiple action sets are allowed for a single alert and can be sequenced in the Action Set form.
    Action sets can be enabled or disabled with a checkbox or end date on the action set line.
    On Error Actions for each action listed in an action set can be
        Abort (finish processing the action),
        Set (specify the sequence number of another action set to run, or
        Member (specify the sequence of another action in the same set to run)
    Exercise: Define an Action Set -> AM/Alert/Define and choose Action Set from the Tools menu.
        If multiple action sets are needed, specify a sequence number for each to execute when the alert triggers

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Response Sets and Response Processing:
    Response processing initiates actions based on valid, invalid, or lack of response to message actions issued by alerts.
        It is only valid for message actions
    Response values that are returned with the response allow different actions to take place, only if the response is a valid response.
    Response actions are actions triggered by response to an alert action such as a message.
    Response sets group response actions the same way action sets group the original actions.
        Response sets determine the sequence of response actions
    Response variables can be defined for response actions - these variables are set by the response to the original alert action.
        Response variables are defined with leading '&'s the same as action output variables
    Response variable names are entered without the leading '&'.
        Response variable names must be different to alert output variable names
    Response action types are:
        valid,
        invalid and
        no-response.
            For no-response types, the wait time is defined in the action definition as Response Days
    Response actions are defined behind each type button on the Response Definition form,
        along with the valid response actions
    A valid response action definition requires a text message with the Response Variable = '?' embedded in the text.
        Subst the "Response Variable" with the actual variable name.
    No text response definition is needed for an invalid or 'none' response
        only the list of actions to be processed if an invalid response or no response is received
    An invalid response action can notify the responder that their response was invalid, and to resubmit a valid response.
    The response set and response days are linked to message actions on the message action definition form
    For Ver 11, Oracle Office must be installed to support response processing
    Message responses are tracked by a message handle (alert installation no. plus sequence no.) for each outbound message.
        This value is returned with the response
    An Oracle Office mail account or some other mail account must be setup on the system to accept the responses
        (ie an alternative is email notification mailer)
    Exercise: Define a response set -> AM/Alert/Define, and click on Response Sets for an alert
    Exercise: Define a response variable for a response set -> from the Response Set form, click on Response Variables

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Predefined Event Alerts for Apps DBA Tables:
    Several periodic alerts are predefined on the Oracle DBA tables that are in the SYS or SYSTEM schemas
    Indexes near maximum extents- raises alerts if any index is within 5 extents of reaching the maximum allocated extents.
        Customizable to a specific index or application user account (ie application)
    Indexes too large or fragmented - identifies indexes with over 100,000 blocks or over 20 extents.
        Customizable to check only blocks, only extents and limit to one application user account (ie application)
    Indexes unable to allocate another extent - identifies all indexes unable to allocate another extent.
        Customizable to check an indvidual index or application user account
    Tables near maximum extents - same as alert for indexes near maximum extents, but for tables
    Tables too large or fragmented - same as alert for indexes too large or fragmented, but for tables
    Tables unable to allocate another extent - same as alert for indexes unable to allocat another extent, but for tables
    Tablespaces without adequate free space - identifies tablespaces with either
        1. less than 100kbytes free space, or
        2. less than 10kbytes contiguous free space
    Users near tablespace quota - identifies any application user account with 95% of assigned tablespace in use
        (or less than 100kbytes free)

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Predefined Event Alerts for Oracle Alerts Tables:
    Purge alert and action set checks
        purges concurrent requests of ALECTC or ALECDC alert processes over 30 days old.
        Both the alert process and the Action Set Check process are purged.
            Action set checks are not purged if responses are still pending.
    Purge concurrent requests - purges all concurrent requests over 30 days old, plus the output files and the log files
    Purge Oracle office messages - purges old messages in Oracle Office
        those more than 60 days old in the Reviewed and Reviewed_OK folders.
        Can be customized to specific folders or for specific users

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Periodic Alerts and Periodic Sets:
    Periodic alerts are alerts fired on a predefined schedule or on demand.
        They can monitor exceptions, system conditions, trigger actions and perform routine tasks
    Periodic alerts are defined the same way an event alert is defined, except
        the alert is on a time schedule, instead of a table insert or update
    Periodic alerts are defined under an application to inherit logon access privileges when they are run.
        Alert names must be unique within the application
    Periodic alert Period Details include:
        Frequency, Start, Finish and Check Interval (optional).
    If the period is set to 'On Demand' then
        the alert can be fired using the 'Request Periodic Alert Check' menu selection under 'Requests'.
        This initiates the ALECDC process
    Check intervals are the time intervals with which Alerts will run a periodic alert multiple times in a single scheduled period
    To run the alert multiple times a day,
        define start and end times for the entire period (eg 8:00 to 5:00 pm) and set a check interval of one hour
    Periodic Sets group periodic alerts onto a single schedule for execution
    Exercise: Run a periodic alert on demand ->
        AM/Request/Check and specify the Application and Alert
        (remember, Alert names are only unique within an application)
    Exercise: Define a periodic alert -> AM/Alert/Define, and choose the alternate region 'Periodic'
    Exercise: Define a Periodic Set -> AM/Alert/Periodic Set, and
        define a periodic set (within an application) and the periodic alerts to run within the set.
        Use the Sequence Number to define execution order

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on the Periodic Alert Scheduler
    The periodic alert scheduler runs every night and schedules periodic alerts that run the following day
    Exercise: Setup the Periodic Alert Scheduler -> Alert Manager/Request/Schedule
        then click the Activate button for the Periodic Alert Scheduler
    It is not available directly under concurrent manager and must be activated using the menu navigation Alert Manager/Request/Schedule

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Alert History
    Enable Keep > 0 to see Alert History otherwise no Alert History is viewable
    Alert History keeps every Alert Check executed
        all the exceptions found (where one row returned by the SQL is an exception)
        which action sets were executed by the alert exceptions
            for the retention period on the Alert definition
    Histories of Responses and Response Actions are also kept against each action history item
    Message duplicats (same output variable values) are flagged
    Exercise: Review Alert History -> AM/Alert/History and query the alert,
        then click Find Checks (alerts run), Find Exceptions (SELECT results found)
            or Find Actions (Action Sets and Actions executed)

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Definition Steps and System Options:
    Install Alerts and setup System Options in five alternate regions:
        Mail,
        Oracle Office,
        Message Elements,
        Response Processing and
        More Options
    Define the alert - as event based or periodic, and specify the SQL SELECT statement for the alert to retrieve the exception lines.
        Verify the alert
    Create actions - as either detail, summary or no-exception.
        Define the type of action: SQL, Message, Concurrent Process, and System Script.
            If a response is sought, a detail message action is needed
    Create response actions
        use output variables and response variables as needed
        test for valid response, invalid response and no response
    Define Escalation Groups and Summary Threshold Groups - optional
        to escalate alerts or create summary alerts if detail alert volume crosses a threshold
    Create Action Sets - to group and sequence individual actions for an alert.
        Multiple action sets are allowed and one action set can fire another
    Create Response Sets - group response actions that will trigger in sequence for a single response set.
    Associate the Response Sets to the Actions (for message type actions that elicit responses).
        This is done on the Message Action Definition form
    The Email System options in System Options specifies the mail system to use and the address to invoke the system
    The Message Element options in System Options allow you to specify the header and footer text sent with a message action
        plus the text for a Response and a Returned Message
    The Response Processing options in System Options include:
        parameters for enabling the response processor including
            the unique Alert ID that goes out on messages for response processing
                plus the scheduled run times for the processor
    The More Options in System Options provide default mail accounts for the user
        and the name of the concurrent manager to use, plus other configuration options.
    Exercise: Setup system options for Alerts -> AM/System/Options
        check each alternate region for required Alerts setup parameters

Alert (ALR Schema) Notes on Key Tables:
    All Alert tables originally in the APPLSYS schema with an "ALR" name prefix are now moved to their own ALR schema
    ALR_ALERTS - main alerts registry
    ALR_ACTIONS - actions for alerts
    ALR_ACTION_SETS - action sets for an alert
    ALR_OUTPUT_HISTORY - output variable values for each run of an alert check in ALR_ALERT_CHECKS
    ALR_ALERT_CHECKS - list of every instance of the Alert Check process running.

Applications Desktop Integrator and WebADI (BNE Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    ADI is a spreadsheet interface to the Oracle Applications
    ADI is a client component up to and including 11.5.10 and a web component starting with 12i (WebADI)
    ADI can perform upload of budgets and journals prepared on a spreadsheet,
        upload of fixed assets and submission of concurrent requests
    ADI (client version) operates in connected or disconnected mode with the applications
    ADI observes segment value security rules associated with responsibilities
    Request Center on the client version allows running and downloading of reports (including FSG's) to the desktop for web browser, text or spreadsheet import.
        Request Center is replaced by Report Manager in R12
    ADI includes an Account Hierarchy Editor with drag and drop editing of the structure of the chart of accounts child and parent values
    Web ADI is introduced in Version 12 through new responsibilities and has no client-installed component
        The client version is not supported in R12 - each WebADI runs under its own application
        WebADI is a framework for building integrators
        It has over 200 pre-built integrators including an integrator for Microsoft Project and for Microsoft Word
        Several integrators are implemented as standard configurations
            Enterprise Performance Foundation: Hierarchy Integrator
            Enterprise Performance Foundation: Member Integrator
            Financial Consolidation Hub: Intercompany maps
            Financial Consolidation Hub: Dimension Hierarchies
            Financial Consolidation Hub: Value Set Mapping
            General Ledger - Budgets
            General Ledger - Journals
            Intercompany - Single Batch Entry
        There are additional integrator that can be added into the 'Desktop Integrator' responsibility
            These must be manually added into the 'Desktop Integration' menu assigned to the responsibility
            The additional integrators are in Projects, Procurement etc and documented in those application guides.
       For R12, in the Oracle Web ADI responsibility the menu 'Oracle Web ADI Menu' is no longer used.
           It must be replaced with Desktop Integration Menu
       WebADI uses standard MIME types (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)

            Set at the user level to match the encoding on the local machine
        select value from nls_database_parameters where parameter = 'NLS_CHARACTERSET';
    Overview
        In Forms, any table with a _TL table will support MLS translations and the World Globe on the maintenance form will be active
        The Globe icon in Forms is only available for forms which are associated to a MLS table.
    NLS or National Language Support supports viewing forms and reports in a national language
        Languages other than than American English are supported
        The chosen language is based on the chosen responsibility
    MLS or Multi Language Support is a superset of NLS and can support multiple languages on a single instance
        MLS supports different languages by a user on the same instance
        MLS also supports different languages on preprinted forms and report text
        MLS tables are the _TL tables
    Character sets can be 7 bit, byte or double-byte (Japanese).
    Only one character set per instance is currently supported by Oracle
        Asian and European character sets cannot co-exist.
            Multiple instances are needed.
    Database Settings
        select value from nls_database_parameters where parameter = 'NLS_CHARACTERSET';
        select parameter, value from nls_database_parameters where parameter like 'NLS%';
    UTF-8 supports multiple languages in double-byte format
        This includes both Asian and European languages on a single instance
    National Language compiled versions of all forms and reports
        They are stored under the $APPL_TOP for each application
        Text is compiled into these files and cannot be modified dynamically
    Adding a language can be done during or post installation
        It requires staging the additional translation patches for the new languages (NLS patches)
        If done during installation, the base language patch must be installed first
    Locale is a combination of Language, Territory and character set
        Naming is "language[_territory][.codeset][@modifier]" (e.g. en_US.UTF-8)
        Set the locale in concurrent requests using the Language button
            Choosing multiple languages will add Layout lines in the Options area for BI Published reports

Applications Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Responsibilities and Menus
    References
        Checking Functions Associated with a User Menu or a Responsibility (Doc ID 948512.1) -- for scripts
    Responsibilities are Oracle's method of controlling access to the applications.
        Responsibilities have an associated primary top level menu
    Responsibility 'Preferences' allows configuration of the personal homepage
    Responsibilities can be customized with new menus
        Menus can include forms from multiple applications to match specific job roles
            This eliminates constant 'hat switching' (responsibility switching)
        An example of this is the Procure to Pay Administrator responsibility in Purchasing
            It includes menus from purchasing and payables.
    Responsibilities are tied to a Business Groups with the profile option "HR:Business Group"
        It is done through a Profile Option rather than through the Responsibilities form
    For each instance of the Oracle applications, there is only one instance of the AOL
        This meands there is only one setup of users, passwords and privileges.
        This applies regardless of multi-org setups
    Security Rules limit access based on data values
        This is done by defining exclusion rule groups and tying to responsibilities
            see flexfields
    High level menus are often customized when associated with responsibilities during an install
        Submenus are most often not customized
            they are simply included or excluded from the top level menus
    Submenus correspond with entries on the AOL navigator
        The lowest level entries on the Navigator correspond with forms
    Menu changes trigger the process 'Compile Security' (FNDSCMPI) or 'Compile Security Menu' (FNDSCMPM)
        These populate APPLSYS.FND_COMPILED_MENU_FUNCTIONS with valid function/menu combinations
        An error ' The Function Is Not Available Under The Responsibility' may appear if it does't work
        Solution:
            Manually run the 'Compile Security' concurrent program with parameter "YES"
            Shut down Middle Tier (Apache)
            Restart Middle tier
            Test the menu item 
    Key Tables
        APPLSYS.FND_RESPONSIBILITY
        APPLSYS.FND_RESPONSIBILITY_TL
        APPLSYS.FND_COMPILED_MENU_FUNCTIONS

Applications Object Library (AOL FND and APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Form Folders
    Profile Option: Folders:Allow Customization - can be disabled to lock most folder functions
    You can delete Form Folders via System Administrator Responsibility
        System Administrator > Application > Folder Management
    Form folders are defined in the FND_FOLDERS and FND_FOLDER_COLUMNS tables
        The WHERE clause is in FND_FOLDERS  for folders saved with a query
    You should never save a folder with the embedded SQL as part of the folder definition
        Do this by setting AutoQuery to 'Never' before saving
    You can restore a default folder if it has been overwritten
        Create a throw-away folder ands save as 'Default'
        Then delete the custom folder - it will restore the original system default folder
        Save the system default folder with the name 'Default'

Applications Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Database Links and Database Files
    Database links can be established to connect data tables from different instances
        Database links are created at the SQL command line to allow access to tables in another database
            This is done by referencing the instance to a fully qualified tablename.
    Tablespaces correspond to operating system files
        One tablespace can include multiple files but two tablespaces cannot exist in the same file.
    All permissions to all tables in Oracle applications are granted to the APPS schema
    Apps server directory structure hierarchy is
        $APPL_TOP/MODULE/VERSION/bin (runtimes)
        $APPL_TOP/MODULE/VERSION/log (messages)
        $APPL_TOP/MODULE/VERSION/install (scripts, source and patches)

Applications Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Security Reports
    List all users assigned to a responsibility
        -> System Administrator/Concurrent Requests/Users of a Responsibility

Applications Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Data Groups:
    A Data Group is a list of applications and their database schema accounts
    The purpose of a data group is to assign a Database schema ID to a responsibility
        so the form/concurrent process can access the database when it connects.
    Each responsibility is attached to a data group
        The responsibility accesses the database using the Oracle user id matching the application called
    One responsibility can have several applications
        The form or concurrent process identifies the application
        It then selects the correct Oracle ID from the data group
    Each responsibility has a data group/application pair
        This identifies the application for the responsibility
        It then looks up the Oracle User ID from the datagroup that matches the application
    One data group can be shared across multiple responsibilities
        But each responsibility must choose a specific application in the data group to use
            (and inherit the corresponding Oracle ID)
    The seeded responsibilities have two possible data groups:
        'Standard' and 'Multiple Reporting Currencies'
    Exercise: Review Data Groups -> System Administrator/Oracle/Data Group
        to see existing datagroups or collections of application names and database accounts
    Exercise: Create or Review Oracle Database User Accounts
        -> System Administrator/Security/Oracle/Register, to see existing database accounts
        -> System Administrator/Security/Oracle/Data Group, to see data groups and their component applications

Applications Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Securing Attributes:
    Securing attributes are used by Self Service Applications
        They limit the rows of data a user or responsibility can view in self service applications
    Securing Attributes can be assigned to a user or to a responsibility or both
    Securing Attributes in the responsibilities block of the user menu can be assigned to users
        They limit what a user can see in self service forms (web apps)
        The securing attribute value is checked each time a function is selected from a responsibility
        Functions that expect certain securing attribute values may throw errors if they don't find valid values
    Securing attributes are defined in the Web Applications Dictionary as the columns in the WAD tables
    Examples of securing attributes are:
        ICX_HR_PERSON_ID - is the person you 'become' in self service apps for iExpense
        TO_PERSON_ID - is the requestor for a requisition in self service procurement

Applications Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on User Exercises
    Monitor Users -> Security/User/Monitor
    Request Groups -> Security/Responsibility/Request
    Responsibility -> Security/Responsibility/Define
    Value Sets -> Security/Responsibility/Value Set/Define
    Monitor Users -> Must set the personal profile option 'sign-on:audit level' first
        Display 'Monitor Users' and query on a user name
    Add Responsibilities ->SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR/Security/User/Define and Find (F11,Ctrl-F11)
        Add responsibilities to the block using LOV's, and Save
    Change User Password >SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR/Security/User/Define
        Query user name, enter temp password and save twice
        System will force new password on login
    View and Create Menus -> SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR/Application/Menu

Applications Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Reports:
    Function Security Menu Report - lists all menu items for a single responsibility
    Function Security Navigator Report - lists the navigator menu for a single responsibility
    Active Users - lists all active users and their responsibilities and effective dates
    Active Responsibilities - lists by application, each responsibility and the assigned users

Application Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Lookups:
    Navigation: Application Developer > Application > Lookups > Common ( AU or 'Application Utility' Lookups)
                Application Developer > Application > Lookups > Application Object Library (FND or Application Object Library' Lookups)
    Lookups are implemented
        APPLSYS.FND_LOOKUP_TYPES (and _TL)
        APPLSYS.FND_LOOKUP_VALUES (and _TL)
    Lookups and QuickCodes are the same thing
        QuickCodes are application-specific terminology (e.g. AR QuickCodes)
        QuickCodes are stored in the FND_LOOKUP tables and assiigned an applicatoin like 'Receivables'
    Descriptive Flexfields defined against FND_LOOKUP_VALUES are 'Common Lookups' in the 'Application Object Library' application
        Each DFF is context-sensitive on the Lookup Name

Applications Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Report Review Agent (RRA)
    RRA is implemented with the FNDFS Executable Functionality
    RRA is the default text browser in Oracle Applications
        It allows viewing of log files and output
        it is also referred to as the executable 'FNDFS'
    FNDFS - FND File Server and Report Reviewer Agent
        is used to retrieve reports from the Concurrent Manager server
    This default viewer must be configured correctly
        before external editors and browsers can be used to view output
    FNDFS is a listener program that communicates with client requests
        via TNSNAMES.ORA configuration and Net8 communications
    FNDFS enables reports residing on the concurrent manager server
        normally on the database node or backend tier to be displayed on the client tier
    The TNS Names entry on the dbserver includes an alias FNDFS<node_name>
        which maps to a fake SID "FNDFS" which launches the FNDFS executable
    If multiple FNDFS processes are run between multiple applications
        each application must have a profile option set "RRA: Service Prefix" set to the correct service name
    Profile Option: RRA: Enabled - must be set to Yes for RRA to return report results

    Overview
         Printing is in PCL (Printer Control Language) or PostScript format
         Printers are defined in Oracle with a specific type (e.g. HPLJ4 is a type)
             Printers are registered by assigning them a Printer Type
             All the resources needed to implement printing are seeded in Oracle against Printer Types
             Once a printer is registered (assigned a Printer Type) is can be used
         Printer Types have multiple combinations of Styles and Drivers
             Each combination represents an implementation of a style for a specific printer type
         Styles are defined for each type and are not specific to printers or printer types
             The style determines the dimensions of the printed page (e.g A4)
             Styles are independent of printer types
                The same style can be assigned to multiple printer types (and therefor printers)
         Drivers are assigned to Styles to send print command strings to printers to implement the style
             Drivers are a series of instructions sent to a printer to implement a printer style
             Drivers in Oracle can also include the name of a linux driver file on the file system that can be read and used
             Drivers implement Styles for specific types of printers - each printer type may have a different driver for the same style
         SRW Files (SQL Report Writer files) are only used by Oracle Reports to format Oracle Reports output
             SRW files reside on the file system and include page dimensions and meanings of special commands (new page, new line, bold etc)
             If output is not to be printed, the SRW file assigned to the style is used by Oracle Reports
             If output is to be printed, the SRW file assigned to the printer driver is used by Oracle Reports
    PASTA and PCL
         PASTA is an Oracle executable utility to convert text files to PostScript so they can be printed on PostScript (i.e. Laserjet) printers
             PostScript is a Laserjet printing language developed by Adobe Systems
         The PASTA patch includes the printer type, printer driver and SRW driver files
             There are three seeded driver files which set page height, width and control character values and are very generic:
                $FND_TOP/reports/PSTLL.prt 66x132 (HxW)
                $FND_TOP/reports/PSTWL.prt 66x180 (HxW)
                $FND_TOP/reports/PSTPL.prt 66x80  (HxW)
                Custom drivers are often defined with different hight and width combinations
         It is a post processing program invoked only if printed output is requested
             PostScript formats output in computer memory and sends the result to the printer, rather than sending printer formatting commands (i.e. PCL)
             The PASTA executable is $FND_TOP/bin/FNDPSTAX
                 The executable has several command line options which override the configuration options in the pasta.cfg file (see below or see Pasta User Guide)
             The standard configuration file for setting PASTA options is $FND_TOP/resource/pasta.cfg on the file system
                 FNDPSTAX reads this file for run-time settings when it is invoked (although run time parameters override file values)
                 The standard config file can be overridden with the -F command line option in the printer driver defined in Oracle
                 This allows the pasta_pdf.cfg file to be substituted (or an other custom configuratoin file)
                 pasta_pdf.cfg is a seeded file to support pdf printing
                     pasta_pdf.cfg contains a 'preprocess' directive to convert postscript to pdf (e.g. preprocess=pdf2ps {infile} {outfile})
             The Printer Type in Oracle is '--Pasta Universal Printer'
                E-Business Suite (EBS) is seeded with this printer type '--PASTA Universal Printer Type'.
                It can be associated with a Postscript printer and it's ready for use with minimal changes or modifications
                This printer name can be modified in $FND_TOP/resource/pasta_printername.cfg
         Command Line Arguments for PASTA's FNDPSTAX Program can be appended to the printer driver definition
             Reference: http://oracleappstechnology.blogspot.com/2008/06/command-line-pasta-through-fndpstax.html
            -c specifies the number of copies to print.
            -el Specifies the error log file's path and name. The path is the absolute path to the error log file.
            -f<?lename> specifies the input file name. Example: -fmyfile.txt
            -F Specifies the configuration file's path and name.
            -h Adjusts the space between lines. The default value is 1.0. If is larger than 1, the space between lines will be larger.
            -w Adjusts the space between characters. The default value is 1.0. If is larger than 1.0, the space between characters will be larger.
            -l Print in landscape mode. (The default is portrait).
            -o<?lename> specifies the output file name.
            -s Overrides the font size option in pasta.cfg.
            -bs Overrides the font size in -s and fontsize for bold font.
            -np No print option.
            -ph specifies the paper height in inches.
            -pw specifies the paper width in inches.
            -pform Converts a PostScript file to a PrintForm file .
            -pf specifies a PrintForm file to be merged in a Pasta output at runtime.
            -pn specifies the printer name.
            -t Banner option for use with the Unix lp command.
            -v Displays the version number.
            -xauto]> Specifies the output format. Two output formats are supported: PostScript ("ps") and text ("text").
        PASTA uses the pasta.cfg file (located for example .../<Host>/oracle/test/apps/apps_st/appl/fnd/12.0.0/resource/pasta.cfg)
            All the definitions for the PASTA printer type are seeded in Oracle
            For Unix, pasta.cfg contains:
               % for UNIX platform
               printCommand=lp -c -d{printername}
           For Windows, pasta.cfg contains:
            % for Windows platform
            ntPrintCommand=print /D:{printername}
        The printer names must be defined in /etc/cups/printers.conf for the command "printCommand=lp -c -d{printername}" to work
        Setting up your system to use Pasta is much simpler than the standard Oracle E-Business Suite printer setup procedure. 
            The Printer Type, Printer Driver, and SRW driver files are provided. 
            The only setup required to begin printing is the registration of the printer with Oracle E-Business Suite.
        Many printing options can be defined using the Pasta configuration file (pasta.cfg). You no longer need to maintain multiple drivers and styles for each printer.
        Pasta is provided as an executable named FNDPSTAX.
        PCL is Printer Control Language - an alternative to PASTA and Postscript
            PCL sends formatting commands to the printer directly and is faster and simpler
            The Printer Type in Oracle in not '--Pasta Universal Printer' but one or more different values like 'HPLJ4SI'
    CUPS Printers
        CUPS Printers are defined in Unix/Linux to support printing over the network
            CUPS uses the underlying LPD/LPR (Line Printer Daemon/Line Printer Remote) protocol and linux commands - a network protocol for submitting jobs to remote printers
            Configuration files for CUPS are in /etc/cups/printers.conf, /etc/cups/cups.conf & the contents of the /etc/cups/ppd/  (Postscript Printer Definitions)
    Printed output is created by Oracle Reports calling an SRW (SQL Report Writer) driver
    SRW defines page breaks, line feeds, bolding based on an SWR Driver File
        SRW stands for SQL Report Writer (driver file)
        The SRW driver file is named in the print styles form
        There is an SRW file assigned to each Printer Style and Printer Driver definitions
            The SRW driver on the Printer Style definition is used for output that is not sent to a printer
            The SRW driver on the Printer Driver definition is used for output that is send to a printer
    Report dimensions are defined in the print styles form
        They override any values in the SRW file
    The concurrent manager calls the print process in one of three modes:
        Command - default mode of invoking an operating system command
            In this mode, the concurrent manager provides four values;
                file name of the print file
                operating system name of the target printer
                title of the file, which appears on the output
                number of copies
        Program - calling a custom program to execute the print process
        Subroutine - calling an Oracle subroutine to invoke the print process
    Printer Styles define the output format of the report
        Oracle can associate a different printer driver to each style
    Key Tables
        FND_PRINTER_STYLES (and _TL)
        FND_PRINTER_DRIVERS
        FND_PRINTER (and _TL)
        FND_PRINTER_INFORMATION - relationships between printer types, styles and drivers
        FND_PRINTER_TYPES
    Troubleshooting Commands
        Printer type, print style and printer driver information is cached in memory; in order for any printer setup form changes to take effect, you will need to bounce / restart the concurrent managers
        FNDPSTAX -v to get the current version of Pasta
        lpstat -a to see all the printers defined in Linux
        lp -d to check if a printer is working at the OS level (wher lp is the 'Line Printer' command
        lpr - the 'Line Printer Remote' command that is implemented in CUPS for network defined printers
    Specific Configurations
        For payments in IBY such as 'Format Payment Instructions' (IBY_FD_PAYMENT_FORMAT') use PDF Publisher as the style

        Metalink Note 105624.1 Troubleshooting (Audit Trails)
        Audit Report : When You Click Button "Select Columns" Nothing Happens. (Doc ID 758457.1)
    Turning on database row auditing creates a shadow audit table to the table being audited
    The shadow table is named the same as the table it is auditing, appended with an "_A"
    There are no standard reports for auditing
    Auditing table that have no unique record key makes reporting on audited records difficult
        The primary table records and audit records cannot be linked
    Auditing should be limited to non-transactional data to avoid performance degradation
    The profile option "AuditTrail:Activate" must be set and requires logout/login to be activated
        Normally this is defaulted to "Yes" at the site level
        It must be set at the application level (e.g. General Ledger) explicitly
    The applicable schema should be enabled for audit
        Navigation -> System Administrator/Security/AuditTrail/Install
            The "Oracle Username" on this form is the schema short name (eg "APPLSYS")
            It is also the corresponding Oracle database Username
    Define an "Audit Group" and associate the schema/application and tables to be audited
        Navigation -> System Administrator/Security/AuditTrail/Groups
        Ensure the "Group State" is "Enable Requested" or it will be skipped for processing
            Otherwise the group will be ignored by the "AuditTrail Update Tables" process
        A group can contain one or more tables from any application, regardless of the application assigned to the group
            'Audit Report' is run by group so a report can only choose from the tables within a single group
        You can define the same table as a member of multiple different groups
    Define the columns to be audited for each table in the audit group
        Navigation -> System Administrator/Security/Audit Trails/Tables
        The User Table Name is the same as the table name - query based on table name
        The primary key columns will always be added automatically if not chosen explicitly
            This can be a number of columns in the table
        The standard audit fields are automatically added (eg CREATION_DATE, CREATED_BY)
        The chosen columns affect all Audit Groups that reference the table
    Run the "Auditrail Update Tables" concurrent process to create the shadow "_A" table
        Ensure the schema is valid for auditing and any related schemas (foreign keys) are enabled
        Two views will also be created for each audited column with the names <audited table>_AC# and <audited table>_AV#
    Troubleshooting
        A Troubleshooting note is in Metalink note 105624.1
        A report "AuditTrail Report for Audit Group Validation" can also be run
            It confirm views, triggers and procedures were built correctly
        If the Audit Group setting "Group State" is not set to "Enable Requested" ...
            the required process "Audit Trail Update" will not pick it up for processing
        The profile option "AuditTrail:Activate" must be set to "Yes" first.
    Use SQL or PL/SQL to access the audit data using the shadow table or associated views
    Records must be purged manually after disabling the audit feature for the tables to be purged
        Navigation -> System Administrator/Security/Audit Trail/Groups
        Choose the group which owns the table to be purged and set the group state to "Disable - Purge Tables"
        Run the "Audit Trail Update Tables" process
        Purge the tables manually using the SQL delete command
        Enable the group and run the "AuditTrail Update Tables" process
    Purging
        As System Administrator, select Security -> Audit Trail -> Groups
        Select the Security Audit group and set the group state to Disable Purge Table
        Run the Audit Trail Update Tables Report
        Purge the data from the shadow table
        Select Security -> Audit Trail -> Groups
        Select the Security Audit group and set the group state to Enable
        Run the Audit Trail Update Tables Report

Applications Object Library (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Auditing Tables - Reporting
    There are reporting options built in
    Navigation: <System Administrator>/Security/Audit Trail/Audit Trail Reporting
    Templates can be created and added to the navigator
    Navigators can be opened to show what is currently being audited - navigate through each template
        This is 'Audit Hierarchy Navigator'
        There is also the 'Audit Query Navigator'that drills down into the table's key values
    Audit reports can be created and run from a report builder page

Approvals Management Engine (AME) (HR Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    Approvals Manager uses approval rules to route documents to non-standard approval routings
        Non-standard approval routings are routings different than employee-supervisor or position hierarchies
        Examples include routing based on charge account segment ownership or item
            Cost Center approvers (based on the Cost Center flexfield qualifier)
            Account (financial account) approvers (e.g. for expense budgets)
                This would be based on the Account Segment flexfield qualifier
            Special approvers (laptop computers, fleet expenses) based on the catalog item or category
    AME uses a role based model for rule assignment in the new security model
        There are five predefined roles in AME

Approvals Management Engine (AME) (HR Schema) Notes on Primary Setup Entities
    Primary setup/configuration entities in AME are:
        Transaction Types, Rules, Attributes, Conditions, Actions and Action Types, Approver Groups
        Setups for rules, attributes etc are all performed within the context of a single transaction type
            In the setup forms, the values displayed or created apply only to the current transaction type context
        Rules
            Rules determine the approval groups that will be invoked for a specific transaction type
            Rules can be defined across multiple operating units or within a single operating unit
            Rules include conditions and actions
                Conditions determine if a rule is valid - the rule is valid if all conditions are met
                    Multiple rules can be defined if one of multiple conditions need to start an action (i.e. OR condition)
                Actions define the steps taken - which is to invoke an approval group
                Multiple actions can be defined in sequence to invoke multiple approval groups
                Actions Types are also typed as rule types:
                    Chain of Authority
                    Substitution
                    List Modification
                    Pre-List Approval Group
                    Post-List Approval Group
                    Production
        Attributes
            Attributes are system variables used in Condition definitions
            Examples are: preparer, requisition_total, line_item
            Many attributes are seeded but new ones can be defined
            Attributes can be static (numbers or text) or dynamic (ERP data references)
                Dynamic attribute queries include calls to packages to retrieve current values
                    that are stored as part of the current transaction (e.g. account segments)
                Dynamic attribute SQL definitions can be valided within the definition form
            Attributes can be header or line level
                Header level attributes apply to the entire transaction - there is only one value per transaction
                Line level attributes are different for each line if the transaction has multiple lines
                Line level capability in OAM is enabled through sysadmin functions for each transaction
        Conditions
            Conditions use attributes to create rules through simple expressions
                e.g. Requisition_Total (the attribute) >= 150000 (the condition)
            Conditions can be numeric (number, date, currency), boolean or character
            There are three types of conditions: normal, exception and list modification
                normal - allow multiple values in a list (like an SQL 'IN' clause)
                exception - can only be used in an exception rule
                list-modification - applies to a specific approver in the approver group only
            The item class on a condition is derived from the underlying attribute item class
                It cannot be over-ridden in a condition
        Actions and Action Types (Previously Approvals and Approval Types)
            Action Types are collections of actions that follow the same rule for selecting approvers
                Actions are performed when a Rule is evaluated as 'true'
                Both an Action Type and one member Action is specified as the outcome of a rule
            An Action is an instruction to AME to include a given set of approvers in a transaction's approver list
            Action Types represent different methods and approver types used to determine the approvers added to an approver list
                Chain of Authority
                List Modification
                Substitution
                Pre-List Approval Group
                Post-List Approval Group
                Production
            They define the steps taken if the rule is valid (i.e. all conditions are met)
            An Action Type comprises one or more individual actions which fires an approval group
                The actions can be fired in sequence, in a named order or together using a voting method
                Since Approver Groups have voting methods, this means voting methods are supported at two levels
                    Between approver groups (action type voting method) and
                    Within approver groups (approver group voting method)
        Approvers and Approver Types
            Approver Types are different database entities such as users, people and positions
                An new SQL package must be built and registered to add a new approver type
            Approvers are members of the Approval Types (such as a person name in the People type)
            Approvers and Approver types are selectable when defining members of an Approver Group
        Approver Groups
            Approver Groups define collections of 'who' is in the approval chain
                These collections are static (listed or named) or dynamic (queried or derived) approvers
                If the group is static, the members must be listed
                If the group is dynamic, a query must be written instead of a list
            Members of the group can individually or collectively approve transactions
            The rule for approving is set in the Approver Group Definition as 'voting method'
                Order Number - each approves in sequence based on their assigned order number in the group
                Concensus - the transaction is approved if the majority in the group approves
                First Responder Wins - only one member of the group need approve - whoever is first
                Serial - approvers must approve in the physical order listed in the group
        Rules
            Rules can be one of several types:
                List Creation - generates a default chain of authority for approval
                    List Creation rules only use 'normal' conditions (not 'exception' conditions)
                List Creation Exception - create exceptions and incorporate exception conditions
                List Modification -
                Substitutions
                Pre-List Approval Group
                Post-List Approval Group
            The first four are different ways to establish an approval chain
            The last two are modifiers to an approval chain that is already created (by another rule)

BI Publisher or XML Publisher (XDO) Tips and Tricks:
    .rtf templates are limited to 63 columns - export as XSL-FO for more columns using the BI Publisher Desktop tool 'Export' in MS-Word
        The maximum page width is also limited to 21 inches using custom page size definition
    Don't use Report Template Names longer than 64 chars - they cause a trigger error in NLS settings in SRS
        The actual template rtf file name can be longer but not the wrapper name for the template in Oracle
    Keep data synonyms in embedded XDO data templates short or they will throw errors
    XDO is XML Data Objects
    You can specify functions using xdlfx, xdoxsl and xsl-fo libraries
    You can include data at parent levels using XSL Xpath navigation from the lower levels (../../..)
    You can get the XML output through the Concurrent Manager Diagnostics page after running the process
    Force text by surrounding data tags as follows: <fo:bidi-override direction="ltr" unicode-bidi="bidi-override"><?XML_ELEMENT?></fo:bidi-override>
        The bidi is the bidi-rectional override attributes on a string and is part of the XSL-FO features
        It is implemented in HTML as BDO for 'Bi=Ddirectional Override'
    Force numbers to format as currencies with two decimals using: <?format-number:FIELD_NAME;'L999G999D.99'?>
    Use the xdo function extension ?xdofx:to_number(Nominal_Conversion_Rate)?> to convert text to numbers
        The extended NLS version options are: <?xdofx:to_number(Actual_Conversion_Rate, 'NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS = '',.'' )?>
        The XSL-FO function doesn't work on negative numbers so avoid it -> <?format-number(Actual_Conversion_Rate, #.00000)?>
    MIME Types must be defined to be used by XML Publisher
        See Note 790854.1 on Defining Excel as a MIME type in fnd_mime_types_tl
    RTF templates create spanned Excel columns if you exceed margin boundaries on the RTF layout - so avoid this

BI Publisher or XML Publisher (XDO) Notes on General Functionality
    XDO is the document extension (file type) for XML Publisher documents
        An xdo document is an XML report definition specifying the data source and report layout
        It is similar/analogous to an .rdf file in Oracle Reports
    A java based application that generates and registers XSL-FO objects for transforming XML into formatted documents
        XSL-FO is XML Style Language - Formatting Objects
    It utilizes the W3C XSL-FO (Formatting Objects) standard for Extensible Style Sheeting
    XML Publisher uses data definitions and templates to publish reports in the desired format
        This includes output from concurrent programs and from spreadsheets
            Data definitions are linked to concurrent output by giving them common short names
    Primary Features include:
        Template library of report formats that can be references by concurrent processes
        Supports multiple formats: Acrobat, Word, Excel
        Supports multiple languages and delivery options
    Core Components:
        FO Processor - to generate PDF from XSL-FO documents and data documents
        PDF Document Merger - creates PDF documents from text data and XML maps
        PDF Form Processor - adds publishing effects to merged PDF documents
        RTF Template Parser - reads RTF document formats and creates XSL-FO schemas
    A Template Manager registers and stores document templates and associates them with data sources
        Data templates are data definitions that point to a data source
        Template Manager can register data sources such as concurrent manager processes (data source registration)
        Template Manager also registers format templates to apply to the date sources (template registration)
            Format templates can be PDF, RTF and XSL-FO formats
        Template Manager provides Publisher API's for other Oracle processes to call report builder processes directly
    Third party forms (templates) can be downloaded and populated by data from Oracle
        Examples are tax forms that can be mapped to an Oracle data source
    Desktop Components
        Publisher includes desktop components to expedite template development
        Metalink Note 36734.1 contains a link to the components for download
            The download for Desktop Publisher 5.6.2 is 5097966 (5.6.3 was released in Nov 2007)
                This patch provides an MS Word toolbar, user guide and samples
        The desktop includes an extension to MS Word for template building in .rtf format
        The template viewer provides advanced viewing of .rtf formats
    Tags in XML Output
        <LIST_G_HEADERS> the start of a repeating group of headers
        <G_HEADERS> the start of a single group of headers

BI Publisher or XML Publisher (XDO Schema) Notes on Date Formats
    You must format the XML native date to canonical format as YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+HH:MM to use date formatting

BI Publisher or XML Publisher (XDO Schema) Notes on Steps for Publishing a Standard Report
    1. Run the standard report
    2. Change the output to XML
    3. Run the standard report as XML
    4. Create a template in MS Word - load the XML
    5. Define a data definition in Oracle that matches the concurrent program name
        The Data Definition short name must match the concurrent program short name
    6. Upload the template and associate with the data definition

BI Publisher or XML Publisher (XDO) Notes on Key Concepts and Embedded Tags:
    Uses placeholders and groups to build a template in MS Word (.rtf)
        Placeholders reference a field in an XML document (e.g. <?CUSTOMER_NUM?>)
        Groups reference fields in the document that repeat for each occurance (e.g. <?for-each: CUSTOMER_NUM?> ... <?end for-each?>)
    There are several tags that can be used to define the primary behaviour of a document
        Create headers and footers:
            <?start:body?><?end:body?>
        Loop through repeating elements:
            <?for-each?><?end for-each?>
        Conditionally show text: <?if: CUSTOMER_NUM=200?> ... <?end if?>
        Select one of several options conditionally:
            <?choose:?><?when: CUSTOMER_NUM < 100??>...<>end when?><?otherwise:?>...<?end otherwise?><?end choose?>
        Regroup based on a value in the grouped data
            <?for-each-group: CUSTOMERS; CUSTOMER_TYPE?><?end for-each-group?>
            This groups the parent element based on repeating/grouping values in one of the child elements

BI Publisher or XML Publisher (XDO) Notes on Integration with Concurrent Manager
    Concurrent Manager output can be send to the XML Publisher through a template
    There is a new block of output options reachable through the concurrent parameter settings
        This displays the templates tied to the concurrent job
        It requires patch 3435480 "Publishing Concurrent Requests with XML Publisher"
            If this patch is not applied, you must run 'XML Report Publisher' request after running the report
            If this patch is applied, you still need to run 'XML Report Publisher' to print checks
    There must be a data template with the same name as the concurrent process short name
        This enables the template to show up in Concurrent Manager Completion Options
        The output format on the concurrent process definition must be XML for this to appear
        The template must be registered as the default template for the concurrent process
            This allows the user to override the default with different output options
            Use the System Administration Responsibility to set the default template

BI Publisher or XML Publisher (XDO) Notes on eText
    eText is a table based formatting template method used by BI publisher for EDI and EFT formats
    EDI is delimiter based and EFT is fixed position based, otherwise they are similar
        This output type is identified in the header as <Template Type>
            FIXED_POSITION_BASED
            DELIMITER_BASED
    Each record or group of records at the same level (nesting level) is a table
        Within each nesting level there can be one record or group of records
        Record lengths can be several hundred characters
    Special handling is implemented by global level (e.g. character replacement) or record/table level commands (e.g. sorting)
        Global level commands are declared in a setup table in the template header (under the 'Format Setup' section heading)
            It is always the first series of tables in the template
        Row level commands are declared in command rows within the record level tables (under the 'Format Data Records' section heading)
            Command rows have no column headings but always have two columns: command name and command parameter
    At runtime BI constructs the output file based on the format in the table
    The system loops through all instances of the XML element corresponding to the table/level and prints the corresponding information
    Data tables start with a <LEVEL> entry which ties the template to a point in the XML Data hierarchy
    The BI Publisher Desktop Tool supports working with eText but not via the MS Word interface
        Navigation: Windows > Oracle BI Publisher Desktop > Template Viewer
        Choose the working directory as a directory where both the eText Template and the XML Data file are stored
        Choose a template and an XML file from the dialog and click 'Start Processsing'

BI Publisher or XML Publisher (XDO Schema) Notes on Key Tables:
    XDO_LOBS
    XDO_TEMPLATES_B (and _TL)
    xdo_ds_definitions_b -- links to concurrent request with common definition code
    xdo_ds_definitions_tl


Bill of Materials (BOM Schema) Notes on Best Practices:
    Reduce varieties using the 'Where Used' Window to identify all using assemblies for a component
    Rationalize products using the 'bill compare' report to compare two similar bills of materials
    For flow manufacturing define 'product families' to group products with similar manufacturing processes

Bill of Materials (BOM) Notes on Responsibilities:
    BILL OF MATERIALS

Bill of Materials (BOM) Notes on General Functionality:
    Bills of Materials are product configurations
    Oracle BOM maintains information about configurations for assembled items
        Assembly can occur in manufacturing or picking for shipment
    There are five types of BOM:
        standard,
        model,
        option class,
        planning
        engineering
    BOM's consist of
        an item number
        revision number and name
        the routing through work cells needed to make the item
        a hierarchy of each component needed (including optional components)
        resources needed to make the item
    BOM's are used by Order Management for
        Pick to Order (PTO) and
        Configure to Order (CTO) items
        to create the configuration to be picked in the warehouse for shipping
    Phantom BOMs are an engineering convenience
        Phantom BOM's are non-inventoried intermediate manufacturing assemblies
        They are used to define final assemblies.
        Phantom assemblies are consumed in a higher level assembly as soon as they are made
        They are not stored physically in inventory
    Planning BOMs are statistical averages of components used in an assembly for planning purposes
    Routings comprise a sequence of operations to make the item.
        Routings include the time needed to setup to make the item and to cleanup afterwards
        These lead times are used by Order Management to calculate ATP dates to a customer
        Routing times are used by MRP
            to calculate lead times used in the manufacturing process for an item
            to schedule arrival of parts
    Resources are associated with operations on a routing
        Resources are absorbed when the operations are performed
        Resources can include labor time, and machine time
    Flow manufacturing uses BOM's and routings but does not use jobs or workorders
        Orders are assigned to a line w/out a workorder
    Configuration items are new items created from a model BOM
        when a configurator order is placed for ATO or PTO assembly

Bill of Materials (BOM Schema) Notes on Workday Calendar
    A workday calendar defines the valid working days and hours for a manufacturing organization
    It is defined by a pattern of days on and days off between two dates
    Exceptions can be defined between specific dates
    Exercise: Display the workday calendar - <Bill of Materials>/Setup/Calendars
    Periods are stored in the BOM_PERIOD_START_DATES table
        One monthly period is generated for each month within the start and end dates
    Calendars must be built or rebuilt once they are defined or changed
        Choose Options/Build from the Calendar menu
        This runs the 'Build Workday Calendar' concurrent process

Bill of Materials (BOM Schema) Notes on Oracle Forms:
    Define Engineering Item

Bill of Materials (BOM Schema) Notes on Key Tables:
    BOM_BILL_OF_MATERIALS
    BOM_INVENTORY_COMPONENTS
    BOM_REFERENCE_DESIGNATORS
    BOM_DEPENDENT_DESC_ELEMENTS
    BOM_SUBSTITUTE_COMPONENTS
    BOM_RESOURCES
    BOM_DEPARTMENTS - manufacturing departments to which resources are assigned
    BOM_DEPARTMENT_RESOURCES
    BOM_RESOURCE_CHANGES
    BOM_OPERATIONAL_ROUTINGS
    BOM_OPERATION_SEQUENCES
    BOM_OPERATION_RESOURCES

Bill of Materials (BOM Schema) Notes on Profile Options:
    INV: Product Family Item Template Name - defaults template for product families
    BOM: Match to existing configurations - looks for an existing BOM to match a new CTO BOM

Bill of Materials (BOM Schema) Notes on Extensions:
    User-defined item from a CTO BOM - by replacing user_item_number in BOMCFGIB.pls
    Custom matching logic for new items from CTO BOMs
        by replacing find_matching_config in CTOCUSMB.pls

Bill of Materials (BOM Schema) Notes on Interfaces:
    Bill of Materials Object Interface - imports BOMS from external systems.

Bill of Materials (BOM Schema) Notes on Concurrent Processes:
    Deactivate Configuration Items
        deactivates configuration items no longer needed (CTO auto-created items)
    Load Bill of Resource
        calculates the bill of resources for a routing to manufacture an item
    Buld the Workday Calendar

Cash Management (CE Schema) Notes on General Functionality
    Cash Management works with the subledgers to match bank payments and receipts and create clearing journal entries from Cash Clearing to Cash
    Cash Management is two components:
        Bank Statement Reconcilation - measuring the match between the Bank Account and the Oracle Financials records in the subledgers
            This includes reconciling the Payables Cash Account (Disbursement Account)
            The actual reconcilation matches Bank Statement Lines to AP Checks for the Bank Account Setup in AP (11i) and CE (R12) (using AP_CHECKS_ALL in 11i)
            For AR the actual reconciliation matches Bank Statement Lines to AR Receipts in the AR Cash Receipt History table
        Cash Forecasting - enables projecting cash account balances at a future point in time using format templates
    Cash Management is integrated with: General Ledger, Payable, Receivables and Order Entry, Payroll and External Systems
        Integration with AP and AR is for reconciliation of bank accounts and for forecasting of scheduled receipts and payments
        Integration with GL is for posting of journal entries for transactions originating in Cash Management (e.g. Bank Charges)
            You can also match bank statement journal entries to journal entries in the General Ledger (account 'book' entries like Interest Accruals)
        Integration with OM (Order Management) is for forecasting cash receipts
        Integration with PAY (Payroll) is to match transactions originating in Payroll
        Integration with XTR (Treasury) for Cash Forecasting including money market investments and foreign exchange deals
        Integration with PA for budgeted inflows in costing and unreleased Project Billing Events in Project Billing
        Integration with External Systems allows matching against transactions accounted in external systems but imported to Oracle to reconcile the account
    Cash Management reconciles bank statements with payables records for each bank account
    Cash Management is a subledger application that generates accounting entries to the General Ledger - primarily to clear the Cash Clearing Account
        Clearing in AP marks the payment as cleared and generates a journal entry to move the payment accounting from clearing to cash
            Cash Management generates this transaction but it is recorded in Payables and transfered to the ledger from there
        Clearing in AR marks the AR receipt as cleared and AR generates the accounting entries to the ledger
        Both AR and AP accounting entries generated by Cash Reconciliation are transfered to the General Ledger using the standard transfer processes
            Both sets of entries pass through the GL Open Interface (in 11i) or SLA (in R12)
    Cash Management also originates accounting entries for bank charges and interest
    The standard electronic bank statement file is the SWIFT MT940 (or SWIFT 940), BAI2 or EDIFACT?
        Cash Management has seeded templates for these three formats
        SWIFT MT940
            MT940 is a widely used standard for bank statements including opening balance, transactions and closing balance
            MT940 documents can contain bank account statements for multiple accounts
        BAI2 - Bank Administration Institute (United States)
        EDIFACT - Electronic Data Interchange for Administration Commerce and Transport

Cash Management (CE Schema) Notes on Bank Reconciliation
    Reconciliation creates entries in several Ledger Accounts: Cash, Cash Clearing, Realized Gains and Losses, Bank Charges and Bank Errors
    Steps include loading bank statements and reconciling bank statement lines against payments and receipts in the sub-ledgers
        Load Bank Statements - into API tables using 'Bank Statement Loader'
        Import Bank Statements - either manually or automatically via API tables, including account balances, receipts and deposits
            Concurrent Programs include:
                Bank Statement Import - to load a bank file into Cash Management
                    To run this program the bank statement must first be loaded into the interface tables
                        CE_STATEMENT_HEADERS_INT_ALL - API for importing bank statement headers
                        CE_STATEMENT_LINES_INTERFACE - API for importing bank statement lines
                    Import errors are stored in:
                        CE_HEADER_INTERFACE_ERRORS
                        CE_LINE_INTERFACE_ERRORS
        Reconcile Bank Statements - either automatically or manually
            Manual reconciliation requires user input to match bank statement lines to subledger payments and receipts
                It can also be used to match off any bank statement lines that were not auto-reconciled
            Concurrent Programs include:
                Auto Reconciliation - produces an Auto Reconciliation Execution Report with matched and unmatched transactions
                    This report is reviewed after running auto-reconciliation and manual reconciliatons can be done to complete matching
                        Use the View Bank Statements form to manually match remaining transactions
                        Also use the Bank Statement Detail Report to examine the bank statement lines
                Import and Auto Reconciliation (streamlined as one process)
            Auto Reconciliation can be run any number of times after correcting underlying data to recast the reconciliation
                It compares the Bank Statement Balance to the Ledger Cash Account balance, adjusting for unreconciled and error lines
                Errors are put in CE_RECONCILIATION_ERRORS
            The Bank Statements Detail Report (or online via 'View Bank Statements') gives a view of reconciled and unreconciled lines
            Reconciliation tags bank statement lines as: Reconciled, Unreconciled/Unmatched, Error (e.g. unknown bank code), and External
                External transactions are transactions not accounted in Oracle - they are treated as reconciled by default.
                Bank lines posted in error by the bank and reversed can be reconciled by matching together and not to a transaction in Oracle

Cash Management (CE Schema) Notes on Interfaces
    Run 'Bank Statement Import' to import and reconcile bank statements
    Run 'AutoRecociliation' which submits the 'Auto-Reconciliation Execution Report'
    Cash Management Bank Statement Open Interface
        Loads bank statement information provided from the bank (can optionally be loaded manually) in BAI or SWIFT MT940 format
            Tables loaded are:
                CE_STATEMENT_HEADERS_INT_ALL - API for importing bank statement headers
                CE_STATEMENT_LINES_INTERFACE - API for importing bank statement lines
        Each bank statement is a single bank header and multiple lines
            The header includes the bank account number, statement date and statement number (and optionally currency and branch/bank name)
            The lines include payments, receipts, miscellaneous transactions (e.g. charges), open interface txns and journal lines
                Each line has a line number, amount, date cleared and transaction type.
                Optional line information includes currency, bank transaction code, original amount, value date, comments and others
        Bank Transaction Codes must be setup in advance to define the Transaction Types that will be read from the Bank Statement
            Navigation: Cash Management > Setup > Banks > Bank Transaction Codes
    Cash Management Reconciliation Open Interface
        Loads bank transactions from external systems that must be included in the Bank Statement Reconciliation
        Steps include:
            Loading the transaction lines into the open interface tables (using SQL*Loader or similar)
    Cash Management Forecasting Open Interface - imports cash flow transactions from external systems for cash forecasting
        Includes Open Interface Inflow and Open Interface Outflow transaction typs

    Cash Forecasting allows user defined templates to project cash forecasts in spreadsheet format (using Oracle Report Exchange)
    Cash Forecasting can include cash transactions imported from external systems
    In a template you define:
        Rows - as sources and uses of cash (and which sources to include)
        Columns - as time periods including GL Periods, or Days (and which periods to include)

Cash Management (CE Schema) Notes on New Features in 11i
    Cash Forecast Integration with Oracle Projects using budgets, billing events and expenditures
    Cash Forecast Integration with Oracle Sales using Sales Opportunities by stage, channel, win probability and status
    Cash Forecast Integration with Treasury for money market and foreign exchange deals
    Cash Forecast Integration with Payroll for reconciliation of payroll cash accounts
    Improved reconciliation support for voided payments (in AP) and reversed receipts in AR (against the original receipt)
        Both voids and reversed receipts can be excluded as available for reconciliation
    Value Dates on payments recorded on payments are updated by actual value dates from bank statements
        Value dates determine the time at which a deposit starts earning interest or a disbursement impacts the balance and interest

Cash Management (CE Schema) Notes on New Features in R12
    Cash Management becomes the owner of Internal Bank Accounts in R12
        The internal bank accounts are stored in CE_BANK_ACCOUNTS

Cash Management (CE Schema) Notes on Configuration Steps
    The general sequence of configuring Cash Management is:
        Set Profile Options
        Set System Paramenters for each GL Ledger
        Define Bank Transaction Codes
        Setup the Bank Statement Open Interface
        Setup the Reconciliation Open Interface
        Setup the Forecasting Open Interface
        Define Cash Forecasting Templates
        Setup Sequential Document Numbering
        Define Request Sets
        Define Descriptive Flexfields
    Transaction Codes used by the Bank must be setup in Oracle and mapped to internal Oracle transaction types
        This must be done for each Cash Account being reconciled to a Bank Account
        This setup is used by Accounts Payable to determine the GL Account for Transactions matching the code
        Transaction Types available to classify Bank Transaction Codes are:
            Payment
            Receipt
            Miscellaneous Payment
            Miscellaneous Receipt
            Stopped - stopped or voided payments in Oracle Payables
            Rejected
            Non Sufficient Funds (NSF)

        https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18727_01/doc.121/e12841/T120505T120509.htm
    Components of the technology stack include (for 11.5.10):
        AT_FP (11.5.10 Applications Technology Family Pack)
        RDBMS (Database v 9.2.0.5 minimum)
        iAS (Application Server, Apache)
            Superceded by WebLogic Server (WBS), Glassfish and Tomcat
        Forms and Reports (Developer) 6i
        Discoverer
        jInitiator (1.3.1.18)
        J2SE (jdk)
        OJSP (Oracle Java Server Pages?)
        JDBC
        Developer 6i Client

Concepts in 11i Notes on the File System and Directory Structures:
    Directories for the database install of the applications on the data server are:
        DATA or DATA_TOP (all .dbf files for the apps) and
        DB (Oracle home for the DBMS system)
    Directories on the applications server are: APPL or APPL_TOP (all application files),
        ORA (Home for the Oracle technology stack of software,
            including Apache and Forms/Reports 6i software)
        COMN or COMMON_TOP (common log files, output, java and HTML)
    The APPL_TOP directory has multiple subdirectories for application files
        forms,
        reports,
        utilities,
        c files,
        includes,
            all grouped by Application and version.
            Each application subdirectory has one subdirectory for each version of the product
    Applications use environment file settings to control execution. There are four environment files with extensions .cmd (Windows) and .env (Unix)
        You can set environment variables by running the .env script for the middle tier
        Look for the file in $APPL_TOP (similar to /(vmhost)/oracle/dev/apps/apps_st/appl/, change permissions and run the .env file (looks like APPS<SID>_<sid>.env e.g. APPSDEV_dev.env)
    File System for 12.1
        Database Tier
            /apps_st/data ... .db files for data used by Oracle applications

Concepts in 11i Notes on Schemas:
    Every application has a 'base product' database schema owner (of data only)
        The database level user ID and password are set the same as the application abbreviation (eg GL/GL)
        This gains access to the database objects for the app (not the application user forms)
    The base product schema owner is used to install all the data tables: tables, sequences, indexes and constraints
    The APPS schema (ie schema being 'owner' of the tables, views, sequences etc) has access to all database objects for all the applications (apps/apps).
        Apps is granted ownership to all the application data tables by the base schema owner
        APPS is granted access to all table objects installed by the base product schema owner
        APPS is used to install and directly own the code objects: packages, procedures, triggers, functions and views.
    APPS in the application database objects are analogous to the SYSTEM schema which has access to all objects in an empty database installation.
        It has access to all code objects and data objects
    APPLSYS is the schema owner for AOL data objects, AD data objects and ALR data objects. APPS is granted access to these objects

Concepts in 11i Notes on Tablespaces:
    The main tablespaces in 11i are System, Rollback, Temporary, and Application
    The System tablespace is owned by the SYS account and holds the data dictionary tables.
    The Rollback tablespace is used to track transactions until they are committed
        This tablespace needs to be set large if upgrading, to accomodate upgrade transaction volumes to 11i
    The Temporary tablespace TEMP is used for sorting data.
        All applications can reference a single TEMP tablespace for sorting purposes
    Every application has a tablespace for data (suffix 'D') and a tablespace for indexes (suffix 'X')
        This simplifies licencing and improves performance. For AP, this would be APD and APX tablespaces
    Application tablespaces are owned by the APPS account
    Tablespaces are created as locally managed using the temporary file option with a uniform allocation size
        This is all for performance reasons

Concurrent Manager (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Responsibilities:
    System Administrator (SA) - to define new requests.
        Most responsbilities have access to viewing and running requests.
    Application Developer (AD) - to define concurrent processes and their underlying executables

        Concurrent Request Data Gathering (Doc ID 740770.1)
        Oracle Automatically Bringing Users To 'View Request' Form After Requests Submitting (Doc ID 1328842.1)
    Request Sets get an id on FND_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS
        Each child of the request set gets it's own id when it is submitted
    Requests stay on FND_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS after they are completed
    Concurrent managers include Internal, Standard, and Conflict
    There are also concurrent managers for each application (eg. GL, AR)
    Concurrent Request log files reside on APPLCSF/log and <Product_Top>/Out
    PMON is the 'Process Monitor'
    Concurrent Managers in Oracle manage background processing and prevent resource overload
    A Concurrent Manager process is used to execute each batch job submitted.
    There are three administration concurrent managers:
        ICM - Internal Concurrent Manager, starts up and shuts down other managers
        SM  - Standard Manager, runs request not defined to run on a specific application managers
            typically configured to run a max of 5 processes
        CRM - Conflict Resolution Manager, checks concurrent programs for incompatibility rules
    There are specific product managers that run requests from the applications
        Each is typically configured to run a max of 2 processes
        Examples are: Inventory Manager, Receivables Tax Manager, etc
    A Concurrent Process is initiated and managed by the Internal Concurrent Manager (ICM) which is a separate program
    Internal Concurrent Manager (ICM) manages all the concurrent manager workers
        ICM polls the table FND_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS to kick off actual batch executions
            It then calls the operating system to run the corresponding executable
    The ICM will normally have only two managers (ie workers) per central processor running on a machine at any time
    In a concurrent request definition you can setup reports to email multiple recipients when the report is complete.
        These emails are processed by the Email Notification Server which must be installed
        The email recipients are established in the concurrent request submission window
            Look in the 'Upon Completion Options' section
    Concurrent jobs can be scheduled to run repeatedly on a regular calendar or schedule, through setup of the process
        Scheduling is done through the 'Schedule' button on the concurrent requests window.
    Incompatibilities are concurrent request sets with individual jobs that cannot be run at the same time.
        They are set as incompatible to ensure they are not scheduled to run concurrently
        Incompatibilities are defined at the concurrent program level through System Administration
    Job priority on concurrent requests is defaulted from the job priority profile option on the user's id
        It can also be set in the job definition
    Jobs are spawned as independent processes to the operating system
        by building a command line of the job name and parameters in the operating system format
    Paramaters can be:
        positional (for sql*plus or shell scripts),
        label (for .rdf reports) or a string in the execution options (for SQL*Loader jobs)
    Parameters are implemented through a DFF with Value Sets assigned to the DFF's
        This limits the options entered by the user to valid options where required
    Concurrent manager schedules a request set as a single job until it initiates
        then it schedules a separate job for each request in the set, with the request set job as a parent
    Requests can be submitted from operating system scripts using CONCSUB (ConcurrentSubmit)

Concurrent Manager (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Request Phase and Status Codes
    Phase Codes:
        I - Inactive,
        P - Pending,
        R - Running,
        C - Completed
    Status Codes:
        U -  Disabled
        W -  Paused
        X -  Terminated (canceled while running)
        Z -  Waiting
        M -  No Manager
        Q -  Standby
        R -  Normal
        S -  Suspended
        T -  Terminating (canceling while job is running)
        D -  Cancelled (cancelled before job started)
        E -  Error
        F -  Scheduled
        G -  Warning
        H -  On Hold
        I -  Normal
        A -  Waiting
        B -  Resuming
        C -  Normal
    Phase Code and Status Combinations
    Innactive (Phase 'I') - Unable to run
        These can be cancelled (or call for help - the Manager may be down and need restarting)
    Pending (code 'P') or "waiting to run"
        Statuses are ('I', 'Q', 'Z'):
            Normal (code 'I') - Waiting for a Manager to run
            Scheduled (code 'F') - scheduled for a future date and not supposed to be running (yet)
            Standby (code 'Q') - program is incompatible with other requests running and on-hold
            Waiting (code 'Z') - waiting for a predecessor process to complete in a set
    Running (code 'R')
        These requests can be terminated rather than cancelled
        Statuses are ('R', 'W', 'T'):
            Normal (code 'R') - the request is running normally
            Paused (code 'W') - the request has been paused by the system and will soon restart
            Resuming (code 'B') - the request has resumed from a pause
            Terminating (code 'T') - the request has been cancelled by the user while running
    Completed (code 'C')
        Statuses are ('C', 'D', 'E', 'G', 'X'):
            Normal (code 'C') - request ended normally or 'Completed'
                This status accounts for most of the entries on FND_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS
            Error (code 'E') - requests ending with an error
                This status accounts for a large number of entries on FND_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS
            Warning (code 'G') - the request has completed but exceptions were found
            Cancelled (code 'D') - pending or inactive requests that were cancelled through SRS
            Terminated (code 'X') - running requests that were terminated through SRS while the job was running
            Disabled (code 'D') - the requested program is flagged as disabled and cannot be run
            On Hold (code 'H') - pending requests placed on hold through SRS
            No Manager (code 'M') - the request cannot be assigned to a manager (none are available) and will not start

Concurrent Manager (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Request Setup:
    An executable is defined to link the actual source file or compiled executable to the concurrent request
        Executable definitions are set up within each application
        An Executable Name must be unique within a single application name
    The application name assigned to an executable defines the directory structure where the source program is sought.
    The execution method is used to determine where to search for the program and how it is run.
        Examples are: Host (script), Reports, PL/SQL Stored Procedure, SQL*Loader, SQL*Plus (script)
        SQL*PLus Scripts are stored in the Apps Server Directory under the applicable application top, for example ...
            /u01/oracle/stage/apps/apps_st/appl/dmcar/1.0/sql
    The executable program name is the actual name of the host file, or PL/SQL stored procedure
        For PL/SQL programs use PACKAGE.PROCEDURE naming convention
    Once the executable is defined, the concurrent program request is defined which links to the executable.
        The application assigned to the program definition determines the application password it uses
        The application also drives where it places output and log files
    Request Types in the Program Definition are optional
        They can be used to limit which programs are run by each concurrent manager or worker.
    Parameters are entered of the Program Defintion form
        LOV's, titles, and default values can be registered for each parameter
    Exercise: Define an executable for a concurrent request -> SA/Concurrent/Program/Executable
    Exercise: Define a concurrent program request -> SA/Concurrent/Program/Define, and assign a name to the concurrent program
        Link the executable and define the program parameters
    Exercise: Define parameters for a concurrent program request -> SA/Concurrent/Program/Define
        Click the 'Parameters' button after defining the program

Concurrent Manager (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Request Set Setup:
    Request Sets have owners but the owner can be left blank
        If blank, only the system administrator can see the request set and change it

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Tips and Tricks:
    The % sign is not needed at the end of strings in search expressions - it is an implied suffix
        This is not the case in the DQM module (Data Quality Management) but is implemented elsewhere (all other pages)
        Searches in DQM are tailored and based on match rules
    Searches are not case sensitive - use uppers or lowers in search strings
    Turn on Duplicate Prevention to have the system identify existing persons when creating contacts
        The same applies to creating people and referencing to existing organizations
        Otherwise Oracle will create a duplicate for the organization or person
    If you enter a new person as a contact all the information (e.g. address) is tied to the contact record
        It is not tied to the person record. The same applies to creating new organizations (as employers)
    To validate geographies in R12 you must assign HZ_LOCATIONS before validating HR_LOCATIONS_ALL
        You don't need to validate HZ_LOCATIONS but you need to assign it.
        Otherwise you get an error when setting validation levels: "Please create a default address style ..."

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on General Functionality
    TCA maintains a model of customers and organizations in the commercial community used by Oracle Applications
    Parties are:
        people,
        organizations,
        branches,
        subsidiaries,
        legal entities,
        holding companies, and
        groups that have commercial relationships
        essentially they are people and organizations
    Accounts fall under parties and there can be multiple accounts for a single party
    Customer Data Hub is a separate Oracle module (IMC schema) and part of Fusion Middleware
    It's primary function is to centralize maintenance of core customer information
        This provides a platform for improving the quality of customer data
        It also allows linking of multiple customer records across multiple systems
            This provides a consolidated view of the customer
    Customers are one of two different subtypes: either Organizations or People
    It can be implemented independent of Oracle Applications to serve third party application needs
    Customer Data Hub is also known and published as "Oracle Customers Online"
        "Oracle Customers Online" is actually the set of java forms and applets used to view customer hub data
        Most of the responsibilities for Customer Data Hub include "... Customers Online" terminology
    There are two products actually two products in Customer Data Hub:
        Customer Data Hub (base functions) and
        Customer Data Librarian (for the data administration component)
    Customers can be organizations or people - the two fundamental types
    Synchronization is provided with source systems to receive updates and transmit/publish changes out
        Source system cross references are maintained to publish out future changes (pub/sub model)
        Source data cross references create a subscriber list for different element types to receive updates
        Updates from and to sources can be real time or scheduled (for periodic updates)
        There are approximately 50 different integration points (data entities) that can be published separately
    Customer data must be initially imported from multiple feeder systems into the hub for inquiry
        It is consolidated by choosing attributes from different records within the data administration
        Conflict resolution allows one attribute to be chosen over the same attribute from a different source
    Duplicate records can be tagged manually and merged through the overview form
        Master records are created from the collection of attributes in the duplicate records
            Users can choose which data components are used from which records to create the master
        Merging requires a special data librarian responsibility to access the "Data Quality" tab
        Merge nominations are submitted to the data librarian for final review and completion
        Match rules are invoked when new records are received or searched, to identify duplicate candidates
            New duplicate records can be prevented in the match rule process
            Existing duplicates can be found in queries which invoke the match rule logic
    Validation is provided with standard address validation
    360 Degree View - is a feature of the data hub where it imports and displays transactional data
        Data can include quotations, sales, tasks or actions, interactions, contacts, attachments, relationships, and hierarchies
        Transaction data is presented by querying the source systems and not loading the data into the hub
        Hierarchies can be obtained from D&B and added to the profile
        Using the "Enrich" button on the customer tab
        Hierarchy visualization is supported by a Java application for visual drill through of relationships
    Question: can the hub be used to centralize location data across multiple applications

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (TCA) Notes on Suppliers Maintained in iSupplier Portal:
    Suppliers who manage their own profiles in iProcurement and the iSupplier Portal are recorded in the TCA architecture tables

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on Business Drivers
    Customer Data Hub centralizes customer data to improve its quality and consistency
        It provides embedded tools and filters to identify and eliminate duplicate entries
    It provides additional attributes for tracking customer information not found in satellite systems
    It simpifies data warehousing reducing cross-references between data from different sources

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on Technical Architecture
    The Customer Data Hub schema is "IMC"
    The hub uses a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) to guarantee uniqueness of customer records
    The GUID structure used in the hub complies with the Open Source definition for GUID's
        (i.e. 16 bytes or 128 bits, e.g. "3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301")

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on Data Content
    Customer Data Hub centralizes certain but not all data entities required by various satellite systems
    Classes of data entities incorporated into Hub include:
        Customer (Company or Person)
        Relationships between customers (employment, subsidiary etc)
        Addresses of Customers and Relationship entities (e.g. people and employee addresses)
        Contact information (email addresses, corporate domains, phone numbers)

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on Contacts and Employer/Employee Relationships:
    Contacts are established within the Relationships area of the Customer Maintenance form
        Contacts within an existing organization can also be queried from the 'Relationships' form area
        A contact is an employee within an organization
    To assign an existing person to an organization (or vice-versa) query the person (or org)
        Then choose the Relationships submenu and enter the existing organization (or person)
    "View History" in the Relationships form allows restoring contacts previously end-dated
    Creating a contact under an organization creates a person with an employee relationship to an organization
        Equally, creating an organization when creating a person also creates the Org as a new org
        To avoid this, leave the organization blank and enter it in the relationships form for the person
        If Duplicate prevention is enabled, a warning is issued if a duplicate 'hit' is found when the org is entered
            Duplicate prevention is enabled through profile options:
                HZ: Enable Duplicate Prevention at Party Creation
                HZ: Enable DQM Party Search -- must be enabled for duplicate prevention but also implements DQM search in Customer setup
                HZ: Match Rule for Organization Duplicate Prevention (seeded default value is SAMPLE: SEARCH)
                HZ: Match Rule for Person Duplicate Prevention (seeded default value is SAMPLE: SEARCH)
    There is a "Switch To" drop down on the Person/Contact pages that allow flipping between a person and their contact record
        Addresses can be assigned to a person or a contact separately
        For a contact address, it only exists within the context of the contact (eg. employment relationship)
    If an organization is entered with a new person a contact relationship is created and any address becomes a contact address

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on Classifications
    Classifications can be assigned to organizations and people
    Classifications include a Class Category (the actual class) and a Class Code (the actual values within the class)
    For organizations only, standard classifications can be used
        These include SIC, NACE and NAICS
    You cannot assign classification values to contacts - switch to the person for this
    Classifications are maintained or created through the administration tab

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on Duplicate Identification and Elimination:
    Customers can be queried based on a character string and selected for duplicate checking
    These duplicate candidates are sent to the administrator as potential duplicates to be combined
    The administrator privilege allows processing these duplicates under the "Data Quality" tab

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on Differences beteen IMC and TCA
    The data hub is based on the TCA data model and uses the TCA registry
        The OCO Administration tab provides access to most of the TCA Administration tools
    Customers are created as parties on the TCA tables (HZ_PARTIES)
    The "Registry ID" on the Customer Overview page is the key to the HZ_PARTIES table entry

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on Potential Benefits:
    Eliminate existing interfaces between OE and AR for customer updates

Customer Data Hub and Trading Community Architecture (IMC and TCA) Notes on Integration and Interfaces with Other Systems:
    Data Hub uses the Oracle Data Librarian to connect with other systems
    Inbound integration requires the feeder system to send an XML message to Oracle
        The feeder system must provide the trigger to create and transmit customer data
        The customer content is posted through the Oracle XML Gateway to the Customer Data Hub
        Inbound XML integration is intended only for customer master information
            Since the XML gateway is an HTTP listener it will accept data payloads in real time
        The XML Gateway authenticates the source and invokes a duplicate checking package in the hub
        Transactional information intended to be fed to the hub - the hub "punches out" (to Oracle Apps) to retrieve it
        Transactional information is displayed in the hub by querying the Oracle application tables directly
    Outbound integration is simplified through Oracle 10g Application Server connectors
        Using the tools available through Oracle 10gAS multiple export protocols are available (not just XML)
        However, there are no pre-packages outbound interfaces so each outbound interface requires development
            This is standard Oracle practice for any outbound interface
    Additional integration functions are provided to the Oracle E-Business Suite
        Real time data checking is implemented to prevent duplicates being created in the Oracle applications
        After customer merge, apps support merge of historical transactions to point to the merged customer record
        Merging also supports automatic realignment of Business Intelligence summary records to match customer merged data
        Oracle apps integration also displays transaction detail from the other applications in the hub forms
            This includes orders from Oracle Order Management and invoices from Oracle Accounts Receivable
            There is no integration to Oracle Accounts Payable for supplier maintenance
        Other transactional integration (through hub reporting) is provided for:
            Oracle Marketing (Campaigns and Events)
            Oracle Leads Management (Leads)
            Oracle Sales Online (Opportunities)
            Oracle Quoting (Quotations)
            Oracle Installed Base (Installed Equipment)
            Oracle Teleservice (Service Requests)
            Oracle Collections (Delinquencies and Broken Promises to Pay)
        There is no integration with Oracle Projects (Billing)
    Customer Accounts linked to organizations are part of Oracle Accounts Receivable integration
        These integrations are not supported for third party products
        The link supports drill downs into account information within Oracle AR
        The supported account attributes (Profile Class, Sites, Contacts) are specific to Oracle AR

Daily Business Intelligence (DBI) Notes:
    DBI is a set of canned dashboard reporting tools
        There are canned dashboards for Financials, Supply Chain and Procurement
        DBI for Procurement offers a broad array of dashboard KPI's for assessing procurement efficiency
    DBI dashboards can be supplemented with user-configured dashboards build using OBIEE ('answers' module)
    Each dashboard in DBI includes KPI measurements, period trends and drill down to actual transactions

Dataload (www.dataload.net) Tips and Tricks
    Use 'Esc' to escape a dataload
    There are a number of predefined spreadsheets at the Dataload website
        There is a link in the information window in the Dataload application
    Watch out for dependent fields in loads - fields enabled by a setting in another field
        These fields will throw out the tab sequence on selected records
    Check that all records exist before running dataloads that update existing records
        If a record does not exist it will throw the dataload and stay stuck in query mode.

Dataload (www.dataload.net) Notes on General Functionality:
    Dataload is used to input data into forms by simulating key strokes to the Oracle forms
    Updated versions of the software are available at http://www.dataload.net
        Dataload classic is free and dataload professional has a licencing fee attached
    Precede a command in dataload with '\' to enter data literally
        If there is no '\' prefix the cell is interpreted as a command
        Commands can be entered as literals also (e.g. \{TAB})
    Timing settings do not affect cells with repeat counts on commands (e.g. {TAB 8})

Dataload (www.dataload.net) Commands
    Any keyboard key can be sent to Oracle via Dataload using the appropriate combination of keys
    See the command reference at http://www.dataload.net/help/macro/keystrokes.htm
    All commands and their decoded values are also listed in /Edit/Commands on the Dataload menu
    Keys have default behaviour and special behaviour.
    Most commands are synonyms for actual commands and are indicated with a leading *
    TAB and ENT are the only command keys that do not require a leading *
    \ means literal or 'keystroke' entry intp a cell - the contents following the \ are keyed literally and not interpreted
    {} means special (often 'non-printing') interpretation of a set of keys
    SHIFT, CTRL, ALT and Right ALT are represented by +, ^, % and & in a dataload sheet
        To send +, ^, % and & to the application directly enclose them in {} to assign them special (non-default) behaviour

Dataload (www.dataload.net) Notes on Running a Dataload
    Create a spreadsheet of the needed commands
    Copy the spreadsheet into Dataload
    Set key delays for all keys used (/Tools/Delays)
        scroll down the list to see all keys
    Choose command group '11i' on the main dataload form to use the 11i keyset
        You can see these commands at /Edit/Commands for each command group
    Open the form in Oracle that needs to be loaded and set focus on the first field
    Run the Dataload

Dataload (www.dataload.net) Notes on Fast Excel Import:
    Open or create a spreasheet and highlight all the cells you want to import to Dataload
        Make sure any new spreadsheet is saved - otherwise Dataload won't pick up any data
    Choose /Tools/Excel Import and Dataload will automatically import the data
    Set Excel import options uner /Tools/Options to load entire sheets, selected data and run immediately

Demantra Notes on General Functionality:
    Demantra is a Demand Planning and Forecasting Module purchased by Oracle in June 2006
        It implements Bayesian-Markov Multi-attribute analysis of causal factors in demand to build forecasts
        This allows what-if impact analysis on the changes due to pricing, promotions, product mix, seasonality and other factors.
    Demantra has a long term relationship with J.D. Edwards
        It is intended to close the gap left by Oracle Advanced Planning and Scheduling
    Demantra has several components in its 'Spectrum Suite'
        Demand Management
        Real-time Sales and Operations Planning
        Trade Promotions Management & Optimization
        Retail Planning and Store Replenishment
    Demantra integrates with Oracle APS to provide demand forecasts
        Oracle APS provides supply network modeling, inventory optimization and supply planning
    Demantra improves on existing products offered by Oracle
        Oracle Demand Management will remain supported and have Demantra as an option
        Oracle Trade Management (QZF Schema) will remain supported but is less functional than Demantra's trade management component

Debugging and Tracing (Trace) Notes on General Functionality:

        How to enable and retrieve FND debug log messages [ID 433199.1]
        How Can Trace and Debug Be Turned On For A Concurrent Request? [ID 759389.1]
        How to Collect an FND Diagnostics Trace (aka FND: Debug) [ID 372209.1]
        How to Obtain Debug Log in R12 [ID 787727.1]
    FND Debug logs store error messages that are written by the PL/SQL code or Java code of the application to common debug table
        Debug messages were decentralized prior to 11.5.10 but are now centralized in FND_LOG_MESSAGES
        Debug messages are written into the PL/SQL code this way:
            fnd_log.STRING(log_level => fnd_log.level_statement
              ,module    => 'xxpo.packagename.procedurename'
              ,message   => 'debug message here');
        Errors message text has different levels and anything equal to or greater than the requested level will write messages:
            LEVEL_UNEXPECTED     : Internal Level Id is 6
            LEVEL_ERROR          : Internal Level Id is 5
            LEVEL_EXCEPTION      : Internal Level Id is 4
            LEVEL_EVENT          : Internal Level Id is 3
            LEVEL_PROCEDURE      : Internal Level Id is 2
            LEVEL_STATEMENT      : Internal Level Id is 1 - this corresponds with Statement Level on the associated 'Level' profile option
    Trace messages (SQL Traces) are written by the SQL Execution (database) Engine on the database and show the SQL executed
        Trace messages are formatted by TKPROF
            How to Enable and Retrieve Trace and Tkprof Files (Doc ID 2100928.1)
    Enable FND Logging using system administrator responsibility
        Set the following profiles at the USER Level
            FND: Debug Log Level = Statement
            FND: Debug Log Module = %
            FND: Debug Log Enabled = Yes
    Run a concurrent process (e.g. Invoice Validation in AR) as aconcurrent request.
    Provide the results of the script after the request fails in a text file:
        select log_sequence,module,message_text,log_level
        from fnd_log_messages
        where transaction_context_id =
        (select transaction_context_id
        from fnd_log_transaction_context
        where transaction_id =&con_request_id)
        order by log_sequence;
    Alternatively search the fnd_log_messages table based on current date and user_id
        Oracle also suggest getting the maximum value before setting the trace and then querying all lines that exceed the initial maximum value
    Search for the following in the debug output
        ORA-
        Return Status = E (for eBTax only)
        Return Status = U (for eBTax only)

Demand Planning (MSD Schema) Notes:
    Based on algorithms from Geneva Planning corp.
    Predefined dimensions are: time, sales channel, geography, sales rep, product and ship-from location. Two added dimensions are user-defined
    Oracle Demand Planning generates forecasts or provides a place to import and record forecasts
    Forecast entries are dated forecast values for specific items
    Forecast sets are groups of forecasts for the same item and organization that combine to give a complete forecast
        (eg to group individual customer forecasts).
        A forecast can only belong to one set.
    Several forecast sets can be defined for different purposes which forecast the same items, examples of different forecast sets could be: Optimistic, Pessimistic and Realistic.
    Forecasts are always for items, and can be at customer level or address level
    Focus forecasts - generated from MRP/INV fit the best of five statistical methods to past shipments and forecast using this method
    Forecast Consumption - reduction in forecasts from incoming orders to avoid double counting.
    Backward and Forward Consumption - reduction in forecast due to sales orders around the order date
    Bucket Type - daily, weekly etc. Used to consume forecasts. All forecast values inside a bucket are consumed before fwd/bwd consumption starts
    Outlier Percent - percent of a forecast in a single bucket that can consumed by a single order (eg 1%). Bwd/Fwd processing still applies
    Demand Class - stamped on forecast and order types, to match forecast consumption (trade channel, geography etc)
    Bluebirds - orders that should not consume demand in a forecast.
        Unplanned orders caused by extraordinary one-time events
    Forecast events are promos, phaseouts, new products/cannibals. Each has a predefined format and entry form

Demand Planning (MSD) Notes on Forms:
    Dimensions -> DEMAND PLANNING SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR/Setup/Dimensions (based measures for a plan such as product, customer, location)
    Hierarchies -> DEMAND PLANNING SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR/Setup/Hierarchies (tie levels into a hierarchy - multiple independent hierarchies allowed)
    Levels -> DEMAND PLANNING SYSTEMS ADMINSTRATOR/Setup/Levels (establish levels that fit in a hierarchy)
    Demand Plans -> DEMAND PLANNING SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR/Demand Plans (to enter a demand plan)

Demand Planning Responsibilities:
    DEMAND PLANNING SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR - configures the demand planning express server
    DEMAND PLAN ADMINISTRATOR - assigns segments of the plan to individual planners
    PLANNER - develops and maintains plans
    PLANNING MANAGER - reviews and adjusts overall forecasts

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Tips and Tricks
    Desupported by Oracle in June 2017 (replaced by OBIEE Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise)
    There are a number of registry settings on the Disco server that govern behaviour like query limits
        See http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B25016_07//doc/dl/bi/B13916_04/registry_settings.htm
    MaxNumListRows is a registry setting that governs the number of rows that can be returned - it defaults to 100000
    Set the Profile Option 'ICX: Discoverer Use Viewer' to no to get access to Discoverer Plus from the Navigator
        If this profile option is set to 'Yes' then choosing Disco Plus will cause Disco Viewer to start
    Define item classes to speed up parameter searches - assign the item class to the parameter by assigning it to the data item the parameter references (i.e. the condition item)
    You can define a run parameter as optional but only from within Discoverer Plus edition
    Use Page Items to improve performance by moving data columns into the worksheet header
        This can limit the amount of data returned in a single query run
    Choose 'Open in Current Database Account' to run a report if you have access to the business area underlying it
    Reload Disco Desktop after making changes to folders in Admin Edition - Desktop caches the folder definitions so changes need to be flushed through
    You can give a description to a workbook but not a worksheet - see the section on naming for guidelines
    The tips and hints that appear in Disco Viewer parameters are system generated for date fields and LIKE conditions
    Access and Privileges to BA's is govered by Administrator
        The Owner or any other with Admin privileges must assign access and check 'Admin Privileges in 'Tools -> Security'
        The assigned user must have Admin rights also via 'Tools -> Privileges'
    Avoid using DECODE statements because the results can't be pivoted in Disco using standard crosstab features

        select fnd_profile.value('GL_SET_OF_BKS_ID') from dual;

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    Discoverer software components consist of multiple tools:
        Desktop User Edition - a client application for building workbooks and worksheet
            Discoverer Desktop is a full featured client application to build Disoverer Reports
            User Edition manages the workbooks and worksheets that select data from the folders
        Administration Edition - to administer security and build end user layers and their business areas
            Administrator Edition manages the EUL schema tables and defines business areas (collections of folders) and folders (queries)
    Discoverer Viewer is an HTML page based application launched from within Oracle Applications to run reports
        You cannot build new reports in Viewer and you cannot copy and modify existing reports
        Discoverer Viewer automatically displays hints under parameters based on data types (e.g. dates) or 'LIKE' conditions (e.g. %)
    Discoverer Plus is a Java Applet version of Discoverer Desktop allowing you to create new worksheets
        You can set parameters as optional in Disco+ and this feature is not available in Disco Desktop
        You cannot save a workbook to your local host or open a workbook from your local host in Disco+
    End user layer - provides report building tools to extract spreadsheet data from the administration level views
    Administration Layer - provides design tools to create metadata (data about data) and views of application base tables
    The hierarchy of objects in Discoverer is:
        End User Layer - a collection of Business Areas i
            An EUL is seeded by Oracle and can be extended
        Business Area - a collection of folders in and EUL
            A Business Area is best defined to correspond to an application (e.g. AP, AR, GL)
        Folder - a query of the underlying database - similar to a database view
            Each business area may have several folders or views
            Folders are denormalized views of data such as journals, balances, invoices etc
        Workbook - a collection of worksheets
            Workbooks are used to group together worksheets but have little logical value
            You can have one worksheet per workbook (often the case)
        Worksheet
            A report run by the user and defined based on a folder
            Similar to a spreadsheet
            There can be multiple worksheets driven off the same workbook
            Each worksheet is the result of a query

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Discoverer Desktop vs. Discoverer Plus vs. Discoverer Viewer
    Discoverer Viewer displays hints under parameters based on the parameter datatype or attached condition (e.g. LIKE)
        It will display a date format on date fields and a tip to use % on parameters attached to LIKE conditions
        You cannot build, copy or modify workbooks in Discoverer Viewer
        The tips and hints that appear in Disco Viewer parameters are system generated for date fields and LIKE conditions
    Discoverer Plus will only save workbooks to the database - it cannot save workbooks to the desktop
    Discoverer Desktop will save books to the database or local host

    You can copy and modify the function 'Invoke Web Discoverer' to force it to display Plus or Viewer regardless of profile options
        On the Function Definition, Form tab, set Parameters = 'mode=DISCO&viewer=Y'

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Worksheets and Workbooks
    A workbook is a collection of worksheets in the same way a spreadsheet is a collection of individual sheets/tabs
    A worksheet is a report and stores the logic for presenting data
    A worksheet is based on a single folder in a business area
    Each worksheet in a workbook can be based on a different folder within the same business area
    There can be multiple worksheets driven off the same workbook and each worksheet is the result of a query

Discoverer (EUL5_SU Schema) Notes on Profile Options
    ICX: Discoverer Use Viewer - causes Discoverer Viewer to display when Discoverer Plus is chosen from the menu

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Naming Worksheets and Workbooks and Adding Descriptions
    You can only do this from Discoverer Plus by double-clicking or right-clicking on worksheet tabs
    Rename a worksheet from the menu -> Sheet -> Rename Sheet (in Disco Desktop or Disco +)
        You can't create a description for a worksheet -> it is not supported anywhere
        You can give a workbook a description (File -> Manage Workbooks -> Workbook Properties (in Disco Desktop))
    Rename a workbook from the menu -> File -> Manage Workbooks -> Properties
        You can also change the description of the workbook with this navigation

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on End User Layers
    An end user layer is a set of database tables on the Oracle Applications Database
    The schema for the standard Oracle Discoverer EUL is 'EUL5_US'
    The end user layer consists of all the metadata used to define the folders in each business area
        This includes column renames, list of values, business area names etc

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Key Tables
    EUL5_US.EUL5_BAS - business areas
    EUL5_US.EUL5_DOCUMENTS - workbooks

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Business Areas, Folders and Data Items
    Seeded Business Areas
        References
            Discoverer Workbooks and Business Areas obsolete in R12 (Doc ID 551354.1) 
    Business Areas or grouping of data queries/views - are normally for a specific set of requirements or functions in a given department
        Typically they should be defined per application - one Business Area per application is a good start
    Business areas and folders are established through Discoverer Administrator
        Business areas are securing entities that consist of folders.
        All folders within a business area can be secured to a responisibility
    A folder is a single query from the underlying database table, view, or set of joined tables.
        Complex Folders include items from multiple folders (fields from multiple tables) related by joins
        Without folders, a business area would be empty
        Folders are based on tables in the underlying database
        A folder can be created from a table directly through Insert/Folder/From Database in the Administrator menu
        A folder can be created by copying a query from TOAD or SQL*plus
        Create folders -> New/Custom Folder
            To add folders, choose the EUL Owner as the owner to get access to the tables
    Items - data items are based on fields/columns in the underlying database
        Items are individual data values based on fields/columns in the underlying database tables
    Discoverer Folders - based on tables in the underlying database
        A folder can be created from a table directly through Insert/Folder/From Database in the Administrator menu
        A folder can be created by copying a query from TOAD or SQL*plus
        Items are individual based on fields/columns in the underlying database
        Complex Folders - include items from multiple folders (fields from multiple tables) related by joins
        Create folders -> New/Custom Folder

Discoverer (EUL5_US) Notes on Security and Access
    Administration Edition Security controls access to business areas
        Sign-on to Administrator Edition with the 'Oracle Applications User' checkbox checked to work with the Oracle EUL's
            You can change the default EUL after sign-on via Tools/Options in Administration Edition
        The Administration Account for the EUL5_US schema is EULAPPS (and the default password is EULAPPS)
        Use Admin/Tools/Security to grant users access to the end user layer definition and business area
        Use Admin/Tools/Privileges and query the user to set privileges then set privileges (everything under administration)
    Access and Privileges to BA's is govered by Administrator
        The Owner or any other with Admin privileges must assign access and check 'Admin Privileges in 'Tools -> Security'
        The assigned user must have Admin rights also via 'Tools -> Privileges'
    Desktop Edition Security controls access to workbooks and worksheets
        You must share workbooks you create with other users or with other responsibilibities owned by users before they can see them.
        Share your workbooks -> File/Manage Workbooks/Sharing.../User->Workbook/and choose the user or responsibility, then choose the workbooks to share.
    Specifically for GL
        Set profile option for the GL responsibility: FII: GL BIS Discoverer access
        Ensure that the Security Enabled flag is set to Yes for all enabled segments of the chart of accounts.
        For accounting segments with no security rule, define a flexfield value set security rule for each segment in the chart of accounts that INCLUDES all possible values.
        Assign the value set security rules to the appropriate responsibilities.
        Ensure that the profile option GL Set of Books Name has been set at responsibility level for the responsibility.

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Running a Workbook
    In Desktop Edition you are prompted to open a workbook in the account where it was saved or in the current db account
        Choose 'current db account' if your account has access to the underlying business area
        Otherwise choose 'account in which saved' and log back on as the owner of the workbook

Discoverer (EUL Schema) Notes on Schemas
    The EUL5_US schema is the base schema for the Discoverer application
    The EUL5_US schema stores all the metadata that define the business areas and folders

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Creating Joins
    Use Insert, Join to create new joins between tables in the end user layer
    Joins are displayed as items in the item list within a folder
    Creating Complex folders - use Folder, Insert, New and tile two windows vertically to drag items in

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Item Classes
    Item classes can be defined in Discoverer Administrator (separate tab) to establish drop down lists for parameter entry
    Item classes are assigned by default to the item that is referenced when they are defined
        They become the LOV class for the item automatically in Discoverer Desktop
        They can be added to additional items.
    Create an Item classes: establish LOV's (drop down lists for parameters), drill to detail, and alternative sorts
        After creating and assigning to a data item in Discoverer Administrator, check the data item properties to make sure it is assigned (a two-way check)
        An alternate order can be defined in the item class to sort the LOV differently to the default

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Headline Fields and Page Items
    Create the headline fields tool bar through the user edition - Sheet/Edit Sheet/Table Layout/Show Page Items (Checkbox)
    Page items move columns into the heading of a workbook and can improve performance

Discoverer Parameter Values and Filters
    Parameter values can be changed through Sheet/Edit Parameter Values
    Parameters can be defined for a sheet through Tools/Conditions
    Speed up parameter search by creating and assigning an item class

Discoverer (EUL5_US Schema) Notes on Crosstab Workbooks
    You can create a cross tab workbook by copying from another workbook
    You should avoid using decodes in workbooks that are pivoted because these may return nulls - DECODES can't be summarized
        See Metalink: Explanation Of Why Totals and Calculations Are Sometimes Blank or Null in Discoverer [ID 208366.1]

Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) Notes:
    EAM is a maintenance system - it enables planning and scheduling of maintenance activities for asset-intensive organizations
    EAM maintains preventive maintenance schedules, tracks inspections and readings, tracks asset availability and schedules maintenance resources
    Properties can be tracked for each asset, and assets can be assigned to groups of assets with similar characteristics and attributes
    Asset bills of materials can be defined to identify components of an asset, and asset groups can be assigned a default BOM
    Work orders and work order history are tracked against assets and asset components, together with the costs of the maintenance
    Rebuildable spares are tracked every time they are used, rebuilt, stored or reused
    A self service interface is designed for supervisors and tradespeople to provide information and tracking for common maintenance activities

Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) Notes on Key Tables:
    WIP_DISCRETE_JOBS - All details of the work order except Failure_Code_Required flag.
    WIP_ENTITIES - Contains Job type (EAM, DISCRETE, FLOW etc), Job/WO
    EAM_WORK_ORDER_DETAILS - Contains only Failure_Code_Required flag, which determines whether failure entry is required for the work order or not.
    APPS.EAM_WORK_ORDERS_V - Contains all work orders where the work order number is WIP_ENTITY_NAME

Field Service Responsibilities:
    FIELD SERVICEE DISPATCHER

Field Service User Exercises:
    Find Tasks -> FIELD SERVICE DISPATCHER/Dispatch Center/.. and choose the 'view by' option to filter the displayed tasks, or click the flashlight icon to display the standard 'Find Tasks' dialog

Financial Analyzer (OFA) Notes:
    OFA supports it's own chart of accounts,  for budgeting, forecasting, analyzing and reporting corporate financial data
    OFA is based on the Oracle Express multi-dimensional modelling technology.
    OFA is populated by exports of data from the GL, including the chart of accounts and the actual segment values - this transfer must be repeated periodically to refresh the Express database
    OFA maps the AFF segments into dimensions and dimension values, aka metadata.
    OFA supports hierarchies on each dimension to summarize values, similarly to parent values on the COA AFF segment values
    OFA receives data from the GL as follows: balances, average balances, encumbrances, statistical amounts, and budgets
    OFA uses 'Budget Writeback' to send modified budgets back to the GL after they are modified within OFA

Financial Statement Generator (RG Schema) Tips and Tricks
    You can use summary accounts in FSG's (including embedded rollup groups) by checking the summary flag on row set account assignments
    You need to use the original responsibility or user to see FSG sets otherwise they won't appear
    'Enable Security' on the Report Definition page limits access to the definition of the report to the person who created it

Financial Statement Generator (RG Schema) Responsibilities:
    GENERAL LEDGER SUPER USER (GLSU)

Financial Statement Generator (RG Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    Financial Statement Generator (FSG) is the report writer for the general ledger
    FSG's are used to define balance sheet, income statement and cash flow reports that are specific to each organization's account structures
    FSG reports account balances by period within the General Ledger but not detailed transactions such as individual journal entries
    FSG's can be exported to ADI for formatting and further summarizations and calculations
    FSG's consist of reusable components: Row Sets, Column Sets, Content Sets, Row Orders and Display Sets
        Row Sets and Column Sets are the primary entities needed to build FSG Reports and are required
    Rows sets are Account Segments or Segment combinations and based on the Accounting Flexfield values
        Row Sets have many values (rows) and can include calculations
        Defining rows in a rowset - leave account segments blank to choose all values
        Alternatively specify a range of account values to limit a rowset to specific accounts
        Name each range to allow printing a text description at the beginning of each row set
           Assign an order value to each range of row sets to sequence the order of printing.
        Display types on each range of rows drive the display of line detail (expand), totals for the group (total), or both (both)
        Define a single rowset for each family of reports, such as balance sheets, income statements etc.
            Don't duplicate row sets and increase maintenance
   Column sets are based on balance types and periods and can have many values (columns) including calculations
        There are 14 seeded column set definitions with FSG
        Balance Types include: actual, budget, encumbrance, statistical
        Periods include: current month, YTD, Last YTD, Prior Month etc
        The Column Set also defines the formating of the numbers for the column (e.g. leading '$')
        A column set is defined in the 'Column Set Builder' window
    Content Sets group and limit the information presented in the body of the FSG
        This grouping and limiting is based on Segments such as Departments or Companies
        They do this by over-riding the row-set definitions on the report
            e.g. A content set can be companies - the FSG prints separate report pages for each company value in the company segment
            e.g. A cost center can be added to a content set to print separate report pages for each content set values
        Multiple reports with different Content Sets can be printed in the same submitted process
    Segment Override on the Report Definition Form restrict output to a specific segment value
        You can use it to restrict output to a specific value in a specific segment or segments
        Segment Override is a more restrictive option that Content Set limits because they only allow one value
    Display Groups limit information that appears on the report by excluding rows and columns based on their sequence number
        The define ranges of rows or columns from Row Sets or Column Sets
        These groups are assigned to Reports through Display Sets
    Display Sets are collections of Display Groups and used to include/exclude specific columns and rows on a report
        Display Sets are directly assigned to report definitions
        They allow Row Sets and Column Sets to be used for multiple purposes
        They implement exceptions to Row and Column Sets as a final filtering process
    Add hoc FSG's can be run from the FSG submission window by choosing 'Add Hoc'
        Selecting a row set and column set directly
    FSG's can be defined or run to produce tab-delimited output to export to a spreasheet for formatting
    FSG's can be transferred between instances through database links
        They do not have to be re-keyed into each instance during a project
    FSG standard reports on FSG structures are all prefixed by 'FSG - ' in the concurrent manager

Financial Statement Generator (RG Schema) Notes on Definition Security
    Security can be enabled on the Report Definition Form with the 'Enable Security' flag
        Checking this flag restricts access to the report definition to the owner
        This security control does not limit access to running the report (see profile options for this)

Financial Statement Generator (RG Schema) Notes on XML Publisher:
    FSG's can be published in XML Publisher for spreadsheet and PDF formatted output.
    You cannot use content sets with the 'Parallel Processing' option to generate XML Publisher content

Financial Statement Generator (RG Schema) Notes on Alternative Output Formats:
    FSG's can be printed to tab-delimited values for spreadsheet import
    FSG's also support XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language) report formatting
        XBRL includes a standard naming convention of XML Tags for naming accounting report values and elements

Financial Statement Generator (RG Schema) Exercises:
    Run an FSG report -> General Ledger Super User/Reports/Requests/Financial
        (or concurrent req "Program - Run Financial Statement Generator")
    Define a report -> Reports/Define/Report: name the report and attach a rowset, columnset
    Define a rowset -> Reports/Define/Row Set: define any number of rows for a single rowset
    Define a columnset -> Reports/Define/Column Set:
    Define an FSG report set (multiple FSG's run in order) -> Reports/Define/Report Set
    Run FSG Definition Listings -> Concurrent Manager, Query on FSG% report listings

Financial Statement Generator (RG Schema) Notes on Profile Options:
    FSG: Enforce Segment Value Security - limits printable output to values allowed by Security Rules
    FSG: Allow Portrait Print Style
    FSG: Expand Parent Values
    FSG: Message Detail - enables maximum run details to the log file for the concurrent manager job to assist debugging
    FSG: Enable Search Optimization - improves performance for large reports with many row sets

Financial Statement Generator (RG Schema) Notes on Reports
    All FSG reports start with 'FSG - ' in Concurrent Manager report lists
    FSG - Where Used, details where specific Accounting Key Flexfield segments values are referenced in FSG's
        This will to assist in maintenance during COA changes

    Setup Steps

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Tips and Tricks:
    You must specify a Book and 'tab out' to see and change asset details from the Asset Workbench
        In the Books form, choose a book and tab through the header to default or display asset details
        This form displays blank values until a book is chosen for the asset (and you tab out of the header fields)
    You can see the value of an asset in both books via the Financial Summary form
    Asset Number auto-assignment is specified by a range in Setup/Asset System/System Controls  (not a profile option)
        You can manually enter a number outside this range when entering assets
        Entered asset numbers can be alpha-numeric
    Assets documentation is often classified under Financials and not under it's own heading
    Asset Key Flexfield must be defined buy is optional for entry
        Define a single segment KFF with no validation to avoid the KFF window opening in forms
    Assets are generated in Functional Currency - mass additions from AP sends transactions in the functional currency to FA
        This is regardless of the currency in which the invoice was entered into AP
        FA only creates journal entries in the Functional Currency - not the entered currency and functional currency
    Asset 'Cost Summary Report' (FACOSTS) and Asset 'Cost Detail Report' (FASCOSTD) reports can be out of balance for transfers, reassignments if depreciation is not run
        Rolling back depreciation before running these reports will also create an out of balance condition
    You can run the 'Generate Asset Trace' report to see all activity on an asset from its point of creation
    You can use unplanned depreciation to simulate a simple impairment

Oracle Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Best Practices
    Periodically run the 'Mass Additions Delete' process to clear out posted, split/posted and deleted mass addition records
        This makes it easy to see what mass additions are not posted via the online forms
        It is run from the main menu and not from SRS

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Terminology:
    Asset Key - an optional key flexfield that can be used to group or categorize assets
    Assignment - the person, GL account and physical location assigned to the asset
    Book - a set of assets and accounting rules - depreciation is run on a book by book basis
        Journal entries must balance within the context of a book
    Depreciation Limit - the maximum amount of depreciation that can be expensed
    MACRS - Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (table based depreciation for different classes)
    Original Cost - the original cost of the asset which includes and cost adjustments made during the addition period
        Original Cost is fixed once the first depreciation is run
    Prorate Convention - the rule which decides when in the month an asset starts (and stops) depreciating
        See Metalink Note 115323.1 The Wonderful World of Prorate Conventions Whitepaper
    Recoverable Cost - the difference between cost and salvage value (i.e. what can be depreciated)
    Reference Number - a unique identifier for an asset transaction (not the asset itself)
    Reserved - fully depreciated
    Source Lines - the project or payable entry that created the asset
        Can be start of month, middle of month, or end of month (for the month placed in service)
    Transfer - change the assignment (location, depreciation account, employee) on an asset
    Reclassify - change the asset category on an asset

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Profile Options:
    Implement Asset Organization Security -> FA:Security Profile - assigns a Security Group Definition
        The Security Group Definition references an Organization Hierarchy and starting point
    Turn auto-numbering on for Asset ID's -> is not a profile option - see System Controls setups
    FA: Use Workflow Account Generation -- determines if FA Account Generator Workflow is used for account generation

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    Assets are organized into Books in the Fixed Assets System
        Books can be corporate, tax or budget types
        Each asset book is associated with a Set of Books on the GL
            An Asset Book is confined to posting within a single GL Set of Books
    Fixed Assets key features include:
        Multiple depreciation methods
        Asset inventory
        User defined accounting rules
        Self service inquiry
        Standard Reports and User Defined Reports
        Tax calculations
    Fixed Asset information is primarily in three categories:
        Physical information - tag, serial number, description, identifying asset number
        Financial information - cost, depreciaton method
        Assignments - person, depreciation account and physical location
            Location is a Key Flexfield structure specific to Fixed Assets
            Exercise: Assign the Key Flexfield for Location -> <Responsibility>/Setup/Asset System/System Controls
    The Fixed Asset lifecycle includes:
        Additions - creating new assets
        Adjustments - changing asset costs, lives and depreciation methods
        Transfers - changing locations, accounts and people (assignments)XX GL Cost Detail Report Set - by Refinery
            The account is the GL account where depreciation is charged
            The location and person are used for tax and responsibility reporting only
            Changing the location or person assignment has no financial impact
        Reclassifications - changing asset categories
        Retirements - full and partial asset retirements
        Changes in Physical Information - tags, descriptions, etc

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Corporate Books and Tax Books
    Assets can belong to any number of books but must belong to one corporate book
        Assets must first be assigned to a corporate book before being assigned to tax books
        Assets can only be assigned to a book where the asset's category is also defined
        Corporate Books can have independent accounts, depreciation rules and calendars
        You specify for which GL Set of Books an Asset Book will create journal entries
    An asset can have different financial values in each book (cost, accumulated depreciation)
    Tax Books exist alongside Corporate Books
        There can be multiple Tax Books for a single Corporate Book
        Assets are mass copied from the Corporate Books to the Tax Books
            The Corporate Book must be closed for the period to perform Mass Copy
            Different options for the Mass Copy include:
                Additions, Adjustments, Retirements/Reinstatements, and Salvage
            The concurrent process for Mass Copy is "Periodic Mass Copy"
        Tax reports include:
            Annual Additions by Date Placed in Service
            Capital Spending
            Property Tax Report - by Location
            Tax Preference Report - Compare Tax and Corporate Books
            Recoverable Cost Report
            Reserve Adjustments Report
            Tax Additions Report
            Tax Reserve Ledger Report
            Tax Retirements Report

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Book Security
    Unless optional security is setup in Fixed Assets, any responsibility has access to all books
    Optional Book Security is implemented by attaching each book to a Fixed Asset Organization
        One Fixed Asset Organization can hold many Asset Books
    See Metalink Note 111129.1 "Oracle Fixed Assets Security by Book" Whitepaper
    Book Security is driven by Assets Responsibility
        Each Assets Responsibility is assigned a Security Profile
            This is done with the profile option "FA: Security Profile"
        The Security Profile definition includes an Organization Hieararchy and "topmost" organization
            It limits the user to the Asset Organization Hierarchy defined in a Security Profile
        One or more Asset Books can be attached to an Asset Organization in Organization Definition
            This is done through the attributes of a Fixed Asset Organization
            When you check the attributes, a Book Definition form appears
                Existing Books can be queried and saved (associated with an Organization)
                    Modify the Book and resave to "trigger" the association to the Organization
                New Books can be entered and they automatically associate with the Organization when saved
        Tax books inherit the same security as their associated Corporate Books
    Steps to define asset security are:
        Define an asset organization and attach one or more books to it
        Define an asset profile listing the organization hierarchy and home organization
        Assign the asset profile to the responsibility
        Run Security List Maintenance to populate LOV's with their corresponding books
        Check access by logging in
    The organization is associated to the asset book in the Organization Definition form (organization classification)
        Use the Assets Superuser or any responsiblity with ASSETS_MAIN menu items
        Query the Operating Unit
        Query the book using QBE exactly, by name
        Modify something on the book so there is a 'change to save' - e.g. the description
        The book is now associated with the organization

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Key Forms:
    There are two inquiry forms: Transaction History and Financial Information
        The most options for finding an asset are provided under "Financial Information"
        You can inquire based on: Asset, Book, Source Details, Assignment, or Lease
    Inquiry is also supported through the i-Assets self service application
        See iAssets Notes in this document for more information on querying assets using this function
    Exercise: Inquire on Asset's transaction history -> <Responsibility>/Inquiry/Transaction History
        Enter a Transaction Reference OR an Asset Number to find the Asset's transactions
    Exercise: Inquire into an Asset's Financial Information -> <Responsibility>/Inquiry/Financial Information
        This provides Source Line, Book and Assignment information on an asset
        It includes book depreciation history
    The primary functions of the "Assets Workbench" are:
        general searches for existing assets
        adding new assets (quick additions and detailed additons),
        performing asset retirements,
        making transfers and adjustments
        inquiring into source (AP, Projects) lines and making source line changes
        Exercise: open the Assets Workbench Form -> <Assets Responsibility>/Assets/Assets Workbench
    All non "mass" asset activities are performed throught the Assets Workbench
    The Tax Workbench" form is used to assign Investment Tax Credits and do Reserve Adjustments
        Reserve Adjustments are manual changes in Depreciation Amounts on a Tax Book
        Exercise: Open the Tax Workbench -> <Assets Responsibility>/Tax/Tax Workbench

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Asset Attributes
    Asset Numbers can be entered manually or assigned automatically to identify an asset
        Leave this field blank for automatic assignment
        Automatic Asset Number assignment is part of System Controls in Fixed Assets
            Automatic Asset Numbering cannot be disabled - it is needed for the internal Asset ID field
            Exercise: View Asset Number autonumbering: <Reponsibility>/Setup/Asset System/System Controls
        Manual numbers must be unique and outside the reserved range of automatic numbers
        Access can be controlled to the Asset Number field to prevent manual entry
        Asset Number is used on many standard reports in Fixed Assets
    Descriptions can be LOV quick codes or manually entered text
    Tag Numbers are unique asset identifiers, attached to the asset for internal tracking purposes.
        Tags can be barcoded on the asset for inventory scanning
    Asset ID - an internal number not displayed on forms or reports
        Set equal to the Asset Number if automatic numbering is used
    Categories are used by Oracle to default depreciation rules
        These defaults are done in conjunction with book and date placed in service
        Exercise: Assign the Key Flexfield for Category -> <Responsibility>/Setup/Asset System/System Controls
    Serial Numbers - are numbers assigned by the manufacturer
    Asset Key is an optional key flexfield for grouping assets
        Asset Key values operates independent of categories
        Exercise: Assign the Key Flexfield for Asset Key -> <Responsibility>/Setup/Asset System/System Controls
        If not wanted or used, define as a single segment KFF without validation so a value is not required
    Asset type has three values:
        Capitalized
        CIP (Construction In Progress)
        Expensed - items that do not depreciate but are charged in a single period.
    Units - the count of an asset that comprised more than one identical asset
    Warranty number - the reference to a previously entered product warranty
    In Use - a reporting flag attribute
    In Physical Inventory - an exception reporting flag attribute

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Asset Additions (excluding Mass Additions):
    There are multiple methods to add assets:
        Detailed Additons - through the Assets Workbench (Additions button)
        Quick Additions - through the Assets Workbench (QuickAdditions button)
        Mass Additions using multiple options
            Import from Projects or Payables
            Upload from ADI - not recommended for large volumes of data
                ADI is spreadsheet based and helpful for editing and cleanup of data to reload
            Special Addition ADI (via PL/SQL)
            Custom posting to the Assets API table (FA_MASS_ADDITIONS)
    Manual Asset Addition Procedure
        Enter an asset through the Additions page
            Leave the Asset Number blank if you are using auto-numbering in System Controls
            Exercise: Check the auto numbering range -> <Responsibility>/Setup/Asset System/System Controls
        Choose "Books" for the Asset from the Workbench
            Enter a book for the asset and tab through the header to default book values
                Assets should first be added to a Corporate Book before adding to a Tax Book
            The depreciation method will default from the Asset Category assigned to the asset
                Exercise: Set Depreciation Method on Asset Category
                    -> <Responsibility>/Setup/Asset System/Asset Categories
        Choose "Assignment" to assign the asset a depreciation account, custodian and location
        Once the Assignment is complete, an Asset Number will be assigned
            This is if auto-numbering is on in System Controls Setup and a manual number was not entered
        The In Service Date must be in the current open period or a prior period in Assets
    Quick Additions Procedure
        Enter an asset through the Quick Addtions form
            Exercise: Open Quick Additions -> <Responsibility>/Assets Workbench/Quick Additions
        Rules for Quick Additions
            No Salvage Value
            Single Source Line (either AP or PA)
            Category Defaults are valid (i.e. existing combinations)
            There is no parent asset
            There is no lease or leasehold improvement

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Mass Additions:
    Mass Additions creates assets in Fixed Assets from Accounts Payable and Project Accounting
    These assets are purchased assets or projects for constructed assets
        A mass addition can be an invoice charged to Asset Clearing or CIP Clearing
            An invoice charged to CIP clearing is added to a CIP asset which is recorded in Assets but not depreciated
                A CIP asset is depreciated once it is placed in Service
            An invoice charged to CIP Clearing and a Project/Task is transfered to CIP in Projects
                No mass addition is created
    It is also an API that can be used to import external data
        Mass Additions is useful for legacy system data conversion and for company acquisitions
        The interface process usesg the FA_MASS_ADDITIONS interface table
    The stages of processing mass additions includes:
        Create Mass Additions for Oracle Assets either in Oracle AP or Oracle PA
            creates mass addition lines for potential assets
            Mass Additions in Oracle Payables are invoice distribution lines that you transfer to Oracle
                Invoice lines distributed to Asset Accounting Flexfields are automatically marked for asset tracking.
            Oracle Projects only creates mass additions on invoice distributions marked for asset tracking.
        Review and modify these mass addition lines in the "Prepare Mass Additions" window
        Mass Additions via AP Clearing
            Get an asset clearing account from an asset category
                e.g. Asset Clearing Account for Materials and Equipment.Agitators category
                    110GB.201.10210.221099999.0000.000.00000.00000000.0000.0000
                Note - all asset categories can share the same asset clearing account in PRML
            Enter an invoice - enter a description for the distribution line - this will become the asset description
            Verify the 'Track as Asset' check box is enabled (show via folder fields)
            Submit 'Payables Transfer to General Ledger'
            Submit 'Mass Additions Create' in Payables to send mass addition lines to Assets
                Check the log file for records created - there is no output report
            In Assets, choose 'Prepare Mass Additions' to assign a category, depreciation account etc
                Change the queue to 'Post' from New
            In Assets, choose 'Post Mass Additions' to create the assets
        You must review and complete all of the required information about the asset
            Exercise: Review Mass Additions -> <Responsibility/Mass Additions/Prepare Mass Additions/New>
            The primary functions of the Mass Additions preparation process are to:
                find and review pending additions
                merge or split assets (where there are multiple assets of the same kind), and
                remove mass additions
            Queues are used to manage transactions in the "Prepare" stage of Mass Additions:
                New (entered into the Mass Additions table directly or by upload/PL/SQL)
                    This is the default queue assigned to additions entered manually through the forms
                On Hold and User Defined
                Split (already split)
                Merged (already merged)
                Cost Adjustment (already added to an existing asset)
                Post (ready to become an asset by importing through the interface)
                    This is the default queue from PA and AP if the data is valid and complete
                Posted (already an asset)
                Delete (marked for deletion and will not be sent into Fixed Assets)
            Entering assets in "Prepare Mass Addtions" requires knowledge of valid categories in the book
                Run the report "Asset Category Listing" for the required book to get this information
        Run the "Post Mass Additions" process and actually create assets from the mass addition lines
            You must have assets in the "POST" queue for a book or it will not show in the run parameters
            Oracle Assets does not automatically convert the mass additions to assets
            Then you post them them explicitly in Oracle Assets
            Exercise: Post Mass Additions -> <Responsibility>/Mass Additions/Post Mass Additions/Submit
                This submits the "Post Mass Additions" Request Set through the SRS window
        Periodically run the Mass Additions Delete process for unprocessed and unwanted interface transactions
            It is run from the main menu (Mass Additions -> Delete) and not from SRS
            The 'Mass Additions Delete' (FAMADEL) process purges transactions matching the following rules:
                SPLIT queue additions already posted
                POSTED queue additions
                DELETE queue additions
                    Lines in the DELETE queue are saved off to FA_DELETED_MASS_ADDITIONS for audit purposes since they were never capitalized
                    These lines can be removed by running the Purge Mass Additions
                    The Purge Mass Additions job is only accessible via the Fixed Assets Administrator seeded responsibility
            The 'Mass Additions Delete' process automatically starts the 'Mass Additions Delete Report' to list all deleted addition records
    There is a Mass Additions Workbench form to conduct tasks related to Mass Additions
        Exercise: Open Mass Additions Workbench -> <Responsibility/Mass Additions/Prepare Mass Additions/New>
    Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Accounts Payable Interfaced Additions:
        Oracle Payables sends invoices charged to an Asset Clearing Account to Assets
            This clearing account would replace the normal expense charge accounts used in AP
        These "Source Lines" are inserted into the Mass Additions table (FA_MASS_ADDITIONS)
    Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Project Accounting Interfaced Additions:
        See Metalink Note 103217.1 Interfacing from Oracle Projects to Oracle Assets Basics
            The final process in Oracle Projects is "PRC: Interface Assets" but several prep steps are needed
        Oracle Project Accounting tracks CIP assets - there is no need to interface them to Fixed Assets
        However Fixed Assets can track CIP for non-Oracle Project Accounting systems
            Optionally PA can be configured to feed CIP assets to Oracle Assets also
        Many fields in Mass Additions are defaulted from Oracle Projects:
            Asset Category (which determines default depreciation rule)
            Asset Cost
            DPIS (Date Placed in Service)
            Depreciation Expense Account
            Location
        Project CIP assets must meet several criteria to be picked up by Mass Addtions
            Date Placed In Service must fall in the current or prior asset period
            CIP costs in Projects must be interfaced to GL
            CIP costs for supplier invoices must be interfaced to AP
            CIP assets must be associated with an asset line

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Prorate Conventions
    Prorate Conventions determine the depreciation taken in the first and last year of an asset's live
        The basis of prorate convention is Date Placed in Service on the asset
        The Date Placed in Service is used with the Prorate Convention to determine the Prorate Date
        The Prorate Date is used to lookup the first Prorate Period on the Prorate Calendar for depreciation in the first or last year
    Setups include Prorate Calendar and Prorate Conventions (before assets are added)
        Prorate Calendar must be assiged to a book
            The Prorate Calendar determines the number of prorate periods in the fiscal year
            The Depreciation process uses the Prorate Calendar for asset depreciation in the first and final year
            The Prorate Calendar must be setup to include every day in each fiscal year
            Common Prorate Conventions are: Current Month, Following Month, Mid Month
                The mid-month convention takes half a month depreciation in the first month of the addition
        Depreciation Calendar must also be established for a book
            The Depreciation Calendar and 'Divide Depreciation' Flag on the book determine the depreciation in each period
            The Depreciation Calender period names must match the Set of Books period names to post journals
    Retiring assets before they are fully reserved also uses prorate conventions
    Navigations:
        Depreciation Calendar: Setup -> Assets System -> Calendars
        Prorate Calendar: Setup -> Assets System -> Calendars

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on the Month-End (Period-End) Close Processing
    Reference: What Is The Period Close Process For Oracle Assets In Release 12? [ID 557948.1]
        The close process for R12 does not require roll-back in order to make corrections
    http://it.toolbox.com/wiki/index.php/Period-End_Processing_in_Oracle_Assets_(Release_11i)
    Period Close in Fixed Assets (Detail)
        Complete All Transactions for the Period Being Closed
            Adjustments, Retirements
        Assign All Assets to Distribution Lines - make sure they are assigned a depreciation account
        Run Calculate Gains and Losses (Optional)
            You can run this process from Standard Request Submission or from the menu
        Run Depreciation
            Navigation: Depreciation -> Run Depreciation -> Uncheck 'Close Period'
            Note that you must subsequently roll back this depreciation run before doing a 'closing' run
                When you run the closing depreciation run it is final - the period cannot be reopened
            This process starts a request set comprising:
                Generate Accounts (parameter: book) - builds accounting combinations for all entries
                Calculate Gains and Losses (paramters: book, period) - resulting from retirements
                Depreciation Run (paramters: book, period) - calculates depreciation expense
                Journal Entry Reserve Ledger Report - runs either the Journal Entry Reserve Report or Tax Reserve Ledger Report
                    It depends on the book chosen as to which report is run (Journal or Tax)
                    This report shows the period, year to date and reserve depreciation (accumulated depreciation)
            View Requests -> Find -> and find the Depreciation Run Request Set
                Review the Depreciation Reserve Report and confirm the calculations
        Submit Depreciation Journal Entries (normally you do this on the 'closing' run although you can do it on any run)
            Navigation: Journal Entries -> Standard
                Enter the book to create journal entries - this starts the 'Create Journal Entries' job
                Enter the period to create the journal entries
            View the unposted asset journals in the USD Book
               Source will be 'Assets'
               Categories will be 'Addition', 'Adjustment', 'Depreciation', 'Retirement' and 'Transfer'
               Don't post these journals - leave them unposted
        Rollback the Depreciation
            You rollback in the reverse order of creating depreciation
                First rollback the journals created in GL
                    Navigation: Journal Entries -> Rollback Journal Entries
                    This deletes the unposted batches in the General Ledger and unwinds the accounting entries in Fixed Assets
                Second rollback the depreciation calculated in Fixed Assets
                    Navigation: Depreication -> Rollback Depreciation
                    This reverses the period depreciation and unwinds the change to depreciation reserve in Fixed Assets
        Rollback Depreciation and/or Rollback Journal Entries (Optional)
        Create Deferred Depreciation Journal Entries (Optional)
        Depreciation Projections(Optional)
        Review and Post Journal Entries
        Reconcile Oracle Assets to Oracle General Ledger Using Reports
            Reconcile the Cost Accounts on General Ledger
                Run the Asset Summary Report - compare balances to GL for opening and closing cost account totals
                Run the Asset Additions Report
                Run the Asset Retirements Report
                Run the Asset Adjustments Report and Compare.
        Run Responsibility Reports (Optional)
        Archive and Purge Transactions (Optional)
    Issues with Fixed Assets at Coryton (Detail)
        Special Year End Procedures including Roll Forward
        The Oracle User Guides need to be added to the class material and distributed
        There is confusion about the business areas deployed in Discoverer - they appear to overlap and some don't work as expected
            This may be unfamiliarity with the business areas - detailed documentation is needed and the old business areas need to be deleted
        How do you rollback if the journal is posted - workaround

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Accounting and Journal Entries
    Tips
        You can run 'Create Journal Entries' any number of times in a period but only after you run depreciation
            Runing 'Create Joural Entries' without first running Depreciation will throw an error
        You can roll back journal entries if they are not posted - from the same menu root where you submit 'Create Journal Entries'
        Once final depreciation is run, you can only 'Create Journal Entries one more time
    Journal entries are created for: additions, depreciation, adjustments, transfers, gain/loss and retirements
        Journal entries are created within a single GL Set of Books
        Each asset book is associated with a single GL Set of Books
        Journals can post to any company within the GL Set of Books, based on accounting rules
    The GL Period must be open to post depreciation
    Period Names in Fixed Assets must match Period Names in the GL
        Exercise: View Periods -> <Assets Responsibility>/Setup/Asset System/Calendars (query all, page down)
    Journals are created and sent to GL using the "Create Journal Entries" process in Concurrent Manager
        Navigation -> can be via SRS or via the menu 'Journal Entries -> Standard'
        Parameters include a single book and period
        Only books that can create journals are selectable
        Important - You must run Depreciation first or this job will error out
    Fixed Assets versions 11.5.10 and above create journal entries in the GL_INTERFACE table
        They must be reviewed and imported as unposted journals within GL
        Fixed Assets versions prior to 11.5.10 do not insert records into GL_INTERFACE which is unlike all other subledgers
            They create journals directly in the General Ledger when 'Create Journal Entries' is run
    Depreciation Journals can be rolled back if they are not posted in the GL or if the posted journals are reversed
        Use "Rollback Journal Entries" concurrent process and enter the book and period
        Navigation can be via SRS or via the menu 'Journal Entries -> Rollback Journal Entries'
        The Fixed Assets period cannot be closed or Rollback will not be allowed
    Journal sources and categories are taken from Assets setups
        Defaults are defined at the Book level on the Book Controls Form
            Click the Journal Categories tab to see the Source/Category defaults
    Account Generator creates account values in Fixed Assets based on setups
        Account Generator Rules are implemented through Workflow and Assigned to the Account Key Flexfield
            Navigation: FA Setup (or any setup) > Financial > Flexfields > Key > Accounts > (Choose Accounting KFF) > Search on 'FA Account Generator' item type
            The Account Generator for item type 'FA Account Generator' can be copied, customized and assigned
            Additional References
                http://docs.oracle.com/cd/A60725_05/html/comnls/us/fa/fafb01.htm -- Decide how to use Account Generator
        Account Generator Rules for deriving depreciation expenses are:
            Use the assignment distribution account for depreciation
        Account Generator Rules for deriving other journals are:
            Use the Company from the assignment
                Specifically, the company segment on the account assignment for the asset
            Derive the Account from the Book or Category
            Derive all other segments fromt the Book default accounts
         The 
    Book Level Accounts include:
        Cost of Removal (Clearing, Gain, Loss)
        Deferred Depreciation (Expense and Reserve)
        Depreciation Adjustment
        Intercompany AP and AR
        NBV Retired (Gain and Loss)
        Proceeds of Sales (Clearing, Gain, Loss)
        Revaluation Reserve Retired (Gain, Loss)
    Category Level Accounts include:
        Asset Clearing and Cost
        Bonus Depreciation Expense, Reserve
        CIP Clearing and Cost
        Depreciation Reserve
        Revaluation Amortization, Reserve
    Account Generator Exceptions include:
        Asset Clearing or CIP Clearing (feed from Projects)
        Reclassification - uses expense account of the new category
    Reports for Fixed Assets Journals include:
        Journals Report (for unposted journals)
        Drill-Down Report in Assets - shows all journal lines for each journal posted to GL
            Separate journals are created for each category: reclass, transfer, adjustment, depreciation
        Account Drill-Down Report
        Reserve Summary and Detail Reports
        Asset Additions Report
        Cost Adjustments Report
        Asset Retirements Report
        Asset Reclassification Reconciliation Report
        Asset Transfer Reconciliation Report

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Depreciation Methods
    Depreciation Methods include:
        150DB - 1.5 Times Declining Balance with Straight Line Switch
        200DB - Double Declining Balance with Straight Line Switch
        ACRS - Accelerated Cost Recovery System
        ACRS Personal
        MACRS 30B HY - Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System
        MACRS HY
        MACRS HQ
        MACRS STL HY
        MACRS STL MM
        Several hundred seeded methods
    For table based depreciation calculations individual percentages can be entered by period
    DB Depreciation calcuates double the equivalent straight line depreciation each year
        For successive years, it repeats the calculation using current asset value (not initial value)
        Once the depreciation drops below the equivalent straight line amount, it is switched to straight line
    ACRS replaced Straight Line depreciation in the US in 1981
        It established asset lives based on Property Classes
            These are known as the General Depreciation System (GDS) Classes
        It assumes a salvage value of zero
        It is table based and similar in results to Double Declining calculation methods
    MACRS is a modification to ACRS that adds more Property Classes and introduces a mid-year convention
        MACRS is also table based and Property Class based
    Depreciation Methods are defined on the Depreciation Methods form
        Exercise: View Depreciation Methods -> <Assets Responsibility>/Setup/Depreciation/Methods
    Methods can be one of several types: table based, formula based, calculated, fixed or flat

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Depreciation Processing:
    Depreciation is run by book for a single period and provides the option of closing the period
    The depreciation process includes several steps (within a single book)
        Run "trial" depreciation and review results including error logs
            Exercise: Run Depreciation -> <Responsibility>/Depreciation/Run Depreciation
                Do not check "Close Period" because you may need to rollback
            Trial depreciation is the normal depreciation process w/out selecting the "Close Period" option
            Trial depreciation can be run any number of times before period close
            Rerunning depreciation is accomplished by rolling back the prior depreciation run and rerunning
            Four processes are run when depreciation is calculated:
                Generate Accounts
                Calculate Gains and Losses
                Calculate Depreciation
                Generate Reserve Ledger Report (or Tax Reserve Ledger Report for tax books)
        Once trial depreciation is rolled back, asset transactions can be performed and depreciation rerun
        Rollback if needed and make corrections before rerunning on a trial basis
            Exercise: Rollback Depreciation -> <Responsibility>/Deprecation/Rollback Depreciation
            It can only be done for the most recent period if the period has not been closed
        Run final depreciation by checking "Close Period" to close the period during the run
            This also opens the next period
    The Depreciation Flag on individual assets can be unchecked to suspend depreciation calculation
        If set to "No" then changed to "Yes" depreciation will be caught up
        If set to "Yes" then changed to "No" depreciation will be caught up in the final period of life
        Suspending depreciation does not change the life of the asset
    Depreciation Override is a new feature introduced in 11i
        It allows user defined depreciation amounts to override calculations on specific assets
        It is enabled through a profile option (FA: Enable Depreciation Override)
        Values for Book, Asset and Period are entered in a table
        The Depreciation process uses these amounts and ignores the calculation steps
        Exercise: Choose assets to override depreciation -> <Responsibility>/Depreciation/Override
            Query a range of assets and enter overriding depreciation values
        Key reports for the Depreciation Process include:
            Assets not assigned to book or cost center
            Expensed Property Report (expensed assets)
            Fully Reserved Asset Listing
            Non Depreciating Property Report
            Depreciation Projection Report
    Asset elements affecting Depreciation include:
        Date Placed in Service
        Prorate Convention
        Prorate Date and Period
        Life
        Depreciation Method
        Depreciation Calendar, Divide Depreciation flag, and Depreciate When Placed in Service flag
        Number of Active Assignments
        Cost and Salvage Value
    Depreciation Methods include:
        Life: Straight Line or Table based
            Double Declining Balance doubles the straight line depreciation and subtracts it
                The remaining asset value is recomputed for the next period calculation and the calc repeated
        Flat Rate (Diminishing value)
        Calculated based on a formula
    Depreciation Projections estimate depreciation for multiple books and periods
        Includes: All existing assets and current period adds, reclasses and transfers
        Excludes: Retroactive transfers and adds, fully reserved and retired assets
        The Projection includes two processes - one to populate table data and a second to run the report
        Exercise: Run the depreciation projection -> <Responsbility>/Depreciation/Projection
    What-If Analsis calculates depreciation on changed assumptions such as financial values, methods or lives
        You can also enter Hypothetical Assets and run what-if scenarios
        Exercise: Run What-If analysis -> <Responsibility>/Depreciation/What-If

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Changes and Mass Changes
    Changes to asset key book-level attributes can be made on single assets or groups of assets (mass changes)
    Changes are book specific and do not cross books or apply globally to assets
    Attributes that can be changed include:
        Prorate Convention
        Depreciation Method
        Life Years and Months
        Bonus Rule
        Group Depreciation
        Group Asset
    Mass changes are done through the menu using Navigation: Mass Transactions -> Changes
    Individual changes are done throgh the Book option of the Asset workbench
    Mass Changes allow updates to a key attributes range of assets based on selection criteria
         Enter the Depreciation Method to enable the 'Life Years' field
             Life Years are limited to specific valid values based on Depreciation Methods
    You can change the Depreciation Life of an Asset
        Change the life of the asset within the book
        You must check 'Amortize Adjustment' to depreciation the remaining value over the remaining life of the asset
        Then rerun depreciation to see the result
            See metalink note ID 233909.1

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Reclassifications:
    Asset reclassification involves changing the asset category assigned to an asset
        You cannot reclassify an asset in a prior period
        Asset cost and accumulated depreciation accounts are tied to category
        Reclassification changes these accounts and moves the balance sheet amounts to new accounts
            It does not change the depreciation method, life or prorate rule
        Journal entries are created to move the cost and accumulated depreciation values
    Reclassification can be done by changing the category on a single asset via the workbench
        Simply change the category on an existing asset to effect the reclassification
        You must choose a new category that is valid for the current book (or an error will prompt)
    When reclassed, the Asset Cost and Accumulated Depreciaton account balances are shifted to the new category account values
        These are the balance sheet accounts and don't affect the income statement account
        Income statement depreciation (current) is based on the assignment value, not the category
        To shift these amounts, you should make a backdated change in the current fiscal year to the asset assignment
           i.e. do an asset tranfer
    Mass Reclassification is also supported
        This is new functionality in Oracle 11i and provides a range of criteria for selecting assets
        Exercise: Select assets to mass reclassify -> <Responsibility>/Mass Transactions/Reclassifications
            Run the reclassification in Preview Mode after entering the new category (and other options)
            Run the Mass Reclassification Preview Report to view the results of the preview
                Use the Mass Transaction Number from the Preview as a reporting parameter
    Reports used in reclassification include:
        Assets by Category
        Asset Reclassification Report
        Asset Reclassification Reconciliation Report
        Asset Category Listing

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Asset Transfers and Mass Transfers:
    Transfers change one of the components of an asset assignment:
        Depreciation charge account - impacts the GL
        Location - the physical location for the asset
        Person - the custodian assigned to the asset
    Transfers can be backdated to prior periods within the current financial year
        This can be done on single transfers or mass transfers
    They cannot be done if depreciation is fully taken
    Assets are transfered individually on the Asset Assignment form through the Assets Workbench
        Enter a "-1" in the "Unit Change" column and create a new line with a "1" with the changed assignment
        Exercise: Transfer an asset -> <Responsibility>/Assets Workbench (lookup asset)/Assignments/
        After making a single transfer you can re-query the assignment to see the new values
    Mass Transfers allow multiple assets to be transfered in a single process
        Navigation: Mass Transaction -> Transfers
        A preview is supported to view the expected results prior to making the transfer
        Exercise: Mass transfer assets -> <Responsibility>/Mass Transactions/Transfers/
        Transfers allow to/from values for location, person and charge account
        To run the final transfer process, use the same form and enter the Mass Transaction Number

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Source Line Tranfers
    Amortization Rules
        Source line transfers between assets with the transfer amortized apply to the from and to asset
            The amortization date also applies to the from and to asset

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Asset Unit Adjustments:
    You can change the number of units of an asset in the main asset form (from the Workbench)
    The Assignment Form will open and show "Units to Assign"
    Enter the Units to Assign in the "Unit Change" column and save
    Exercise: Adjust the Units on an Asset -> <Responsibility>/Assets/Asset Workbench(inquire on asset)/
        Change units and enter the incrementally added units in the Assignments  form in "Unit Change"
    Changing the units may violate tag number assignments on assets since they should be unique

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Financial Adjustments and Mass Adjustments:
    Financial Adjustments are changes to the monetary values and associated methods for an asset
    They are performed by querying the asset and then the appropriate book for the asset
        Exercise: Adjust asset financial amounts -> <Responsibility>/Assets/Asset Workbench (query asset)/
            Books (enter valid book and tab to body of form)/view and change financial amounts
    Adjustments can include to:
        Cost
        Salvage
        Life
        Method
        Prorate Convention
    The decision must be made to expense or amortize the change in depreciation caused by the adjustment
        Check the "Amortize Adjustment" box to amortize the difference over the asset's remaining life
        Amortization must be allowable for the book
        All future financial adjustments to the asset must be amortized
    Adjustments can be made to fully retired assets
    No journal entry for the adjustment is made if the change is made to a current period addition
    Mass Changes are also supported through the Mass Changes form
        Exercise: Perform a mass financial adjustment -> <Responsibility>/Mass Transactions/Changes
        Set rules for assets to choose (within a book) and financial changes to make
        Note the option to amortize the adjustments is also provided on this form

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Asset Physical Inventory:
    Physical inventory allows for comparison of assets on the books and assets physically counted
    Key data elements for a physical inventory are:
        The asset identifier: Asset, Tag or Serial Number
        The asset assignment: Count and location
    Physicals can be entered into Assets several ways: ADI, Manual or through an Open Interface
    Once entered, a physical inventory comparison program can be run
    After running the comparison, assets may need assignment changes or retirement
    After all assignment changes are made, the Missing Assets Report is run to determine remaining retirements
        Exercise: query a physical inventory -> <Responsibility>/Physical Inventory/Enter/
            Enter a title for the physical inventory and save before proceeding
        Exercise: compare physical to book -> <Responsibility>/Physical Inventory/Comparison/View

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Impairments and Unplanned Depreciation
    Oracle Fixed Assets has specific functionality for impairments
    You can use unplanned depreciation to simulate an impairment
    Enter unplanned depreciation from the Assets Workbench for a specific book (Unplanned Depreciation Button)
        Create a new Type if needed via Quick Codes (Setup -> Assets System -> Quickcodes)
        Negative amounts are allowed (upward unplanned depreciation)
        Unplanned Depreciation appears as an Adjustment amount and can be viewed in Financial Amounts and Depreciation History
            Exception - unplanned depreciation in the period the asset is added is not tracked as an adjustment
                It is reflecte in Net Book Value and Accumulated Depreciation
        Once entered you can view the results immediately in Financial Amounts - the depreciation is applied immediatelywhen it is saved
    Restrictions on Unplanned Depreciation
        It cannot be split into separate depreciation accounts - enter separate amounts for this
        Unplanned depreciation is not allowed for assets using table-based methods
        Unplanned depreciation cannot be entered for an asset depreciating on Units of Production in the period the asset is added
            It must have historical reserves
        You cannot make expensed adjustments on assets where you have amortized previous unplanned depreciation

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Asset Retirements and Mass Retirements:
    General Rules for retirements include:
        You can undo a retirement transaction if you have not run gain/loss calculation
            A new retirement has a status of Pending which changes to Processed after Gain/Loss or Depreciation is run
            Once the gain/loss is run you must reinstate
            The Undo/Reinstate button on the retirement form is set based on this status of the retirement
                Reinstating a retirement before gain/loss/depreciation simply deletes the retirement transaction
                Reinstating a retirement after gain/loss/depreciation changes the status to reinstated
                    You must run gain/loss/depreciation on 'reinstated' status asset to recalculate financial amounts
        You can do mass retirments or single retirements
        You can retire a number of asset units or an asset cost
            Cost retirments are taken of each asset ratably and do not change the number of units
            The ratable cost is spread across all unit/assignment/distribution lines
    Retirements can be full or partial for individual assets
        Partial retirements are based on portion of cost or number of units
        Exercise: enter a retirement -> <Responsibility>/Assets Workbench (query asset)/Retirements (button)/
            and enter retirment details (current additions must be deleted and not retired)
        The cost of removal or any disposal proceeds can be entered in the retirement record
        Retirement types are optional and have no financial impact (e.g. sale, casualty, theft)
    Mass retirements are supported and require criteria to choose the assets to retire
        Exercise: Enter mass retirements -> <Responsibility>/Mass Transactions/Retirements/
            Create and Reinstate
        Preview mode is supported and the resulting transaction number used to subsequently execute
        Pending retirements are created and posted after running Gain/Loss processing
    Retirement transactions can be imported through an API interface
        Exercise: View imported retirements -> <Responsibility>/Mass Transactions/Retirements/Prepare
            and query on the book with the imported retirements
            The Queue must be "Post" in order for the retirements to be picked up
    Retired assets may be reinstated if they were retired in the current year
        Partial retirements can only be reinstated if no following transactions have occured
    Retirements can be backdated to prior periods in the same financial year
        If retirements are performed in a prior period, depreciation expense is backed out
    Retirements can be mass-copied to Tax Books (optional)
    Current period asset additions must be deleted and cannot be retired
    If untaken depreciaton exists, retirements create accounting entries
        Avoid this by making a cost adjustment to zero in a prior period before retiring

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Key Flexfields:
    Fixed Assets has three Key Flexfields
        Category Flexfield - depreciation rules are defaulted from category values
        Location Flexfield - specific to Fixed Assets and not part of HR Locatins
        Asset Key Flexfield - an additional grouping and reporting code that is optional
    Exercise: Assign the Asset Key Flexfield Structures -> <Responsibility>/Setup/Asset System/System Controls
    Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Flexfields:
        Look up flexfields under the "Assets" application name (not "Fixed Assets")
        "Asset Key Flexfield" - a grouping key flexfield for asset classification (optional and unrelated to categories)
        "Category Flexfield" - a grouping key flexfield that defaults the depreciation method on assets
        "Location Flexfield" - a descriptive flexfield that is specific to assets (not related to HR Locations)

    At what organizational level is a Fixed Assets Book defined?
        Set of Books level - each Asset Book is attached to a GL Set of Books in it's definition
        Using Organization Security, you can attach an Asset Book to an Asset Organization for tighter control

Fixed Assets (FA Schema) Notes on Setup Steps:
    Additional Referneces
        See Metalink Note 116607.1 Financials 11i Assets Setup (for CRL Assets depreciated in groups)
    Important setups include:
        GL Set of Books
            Exercise: Assign Set of Books to Asset Book ->
                <Assets Responsibility>/Setup/Assets System/Book Controls
        Asset Key Flexfield - including structure and values (used for reporting, optional)
        Asset Category Flexfield - including structure and values
            Once established, each Asset Category must be assigned a collection of default values
            Categories should be defined based on depreciation rules (prorate convention, depreciation method, life)
        Location Flexfield including structure and values - aliases are optional
            Each of these three setups are attached to Fixed Assets in the System Controls Form
            Exercise: Attach Key Flexfields to System Controls ->
            <Assets Responsibility/Setup/Assets System/
                System Controls
        System Controls includes:
            Key Flexfield associations, oldest DPIS date and asset auto-numbering range
        Fiscal Years - define collections of years and ending dates
            The standard years are calendar years ending in December each year
                Exercise: View Fiscal Years ->
                    <Assets Responsibility>/Setup/Assets System/Fiscal Years
            The fiscal years should at least go back to the oldest DPIS defined in System Controls
        Calendars - define periods within a year based on accounting conventions
            See Metalink Note 139937.1 Calendar Usage and Setup
            Each book requires a Depreciation Calendar and a Prorate Calendar
                The Depreciation Calendar defines the number of accounting periods in the fiscal year
                The Prorate Calendar defines the number of prorate periods in the fiscal year
                The same calendar can be used for Depreciation and Proration in multiple books

    Several Setups are Required but Defaulted
        Account Generator Workflow
        JE Sources and Categories
        Quickcodes are extendable lists of values for fields that appear throught Fixed Assets
            Quickcodes can be ignored in some cases - users can type in values on the fly
            An example is Asset Description where a user can look up a predefined value or create one
            Exercise: View Quickcodes -> <Assets Responsibility>/Setup/Assets System/Quickcodes
            Quickcodes can be modified in some cases and extended in others
                Some Quickcodes can be modified by changing the description but not the code values
                Some Quickcodes can be completely user defined and extensible
                Some Quickcodes cannot be modified and cannot be supplemented
                Some Quickcodes come with seeded values which can be deleted or over-written
                You cannot create new sets of Quickcodes - they are system controlled and defined
            Quickcodes sets include:
                Asset Descriptions - can be extended, modified and created on the fly
                Journal Entries - only the descriptions can be changed
                Lease Periods - are user defined
                Property Type - can be extended, modified and created on the fly
                Queue Names - Values DELETE, ON HOLD and POST cannot be changed
                RX Parameters - Report Exchange (RXi) parameters can be extended and modified
                Retirement - are user defined (examples are SALE, CASUALTY)
                Secured Program - are pre-seeded and can be extended
                Source Line Type - are user defined and pre-seeded (MATERIAL, NON-MATERIAL)

Flexfield and Value Set (FND Schema) Tips and Tricks:
    To find flexfields use the Oracle Applications as a search criteria
    Assign all "required" segment qualifiers to KFF segments or compiliation will fail

Flexfield and Value Set (FND Schema) Notes on Terminology:
    Value Set - container for segment values
    Structure - a specific configuration of segments in a Flexfield
    Qualifier - a special meaning assigned to a KFF segment (some are required)

Flexfields and Value Sets (FND Schema) Notes on Responsibilities:
    System Administration
    System Administrator
        Use System Administrator to create and maintain flexfields

Flexfield and Value Set (FND Schema) Best Practices:
    Add extra characters or length to short segments in flexfields to allow for future growth
    Define value sets as queries on other tables where appropriate to reduce maintenance
        This will eliminate manual maintenance of independent and dependent value set values
    Plan flexfields carefully in advance - they cannot be easily changed once defined and used
    Limit KFF segment lengths to avoid exceeding reporting column widths

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on General Features:
    There is a Descriptive Flexfield Register form (Form FNDFFIDF) which allows lookup by table name
        Navigation: Inventory > Setup > Descriptive Flexfield Register
        Navigation: Application Developer
    The term Flexfield is derived from "Flexible Fields"
    Flexfields provide user-defined fields in Oracle applications
    There are two kinds of Flexfields:
        Key Flexfields (KFF's) which are record key fields comprising multi-segments parts
        Descriptive Flexfields (DFF's) which are multi-field user-defined data attributes
        When opened in a form, the key or descriptive flexfields display in a separate window
            This window has their individual named segments as separate fields
            Each field displays a user-defined prompt and value
        Both Key and Descriptive Flexfields allow user defined rules for valid values (domains)
        Examples of Key Flexfields are:
            GL Account Code Combinations
            Asset Categories, Asset Keys, Asset Locations
            Inventory Item Numbers
            Sales Territories
            Sales Taxes
            HR Jobs and Postions
        The seeded Key FlexFields are
            Accounting Flexfield GL GL_CODE_COMBINATIONS CHART_OF_ACCOUNTS_ID
            Assets KFF FA FA_ASSET_KEYWORDS
            Category Flexfield FA FA_CATEGORIES_B
            Location Flexfield FA FA_LOCATIONS
            Sales Tax Location Flexfield AR AR_LOCATION_COMBINATIONS LOCATION_STRUCTURE_ID
            Territory Flexfield AR RA_TERRITORIES
            Item Catalogs INV MTL_ITEM_CATALOG_GROUPS
            Item Categories INV MTL_CATEGORIES_B  STRUCTURE_ID
            Stock Locators INV MTL_ITEM_LOCATIONS ORGANIZATION_ID
            System Items INV MTL_SYSTEM_ITEMS_B  ORGANIZATION_ID
        Details of all seeded KFF's for all applications are in the Flexfields User Guide
    A flexfield structure is a specific configuration of segments.
        Both key and descriptive flexfields support more than one structure.
            In Inventory the system item key flexfield has only one structure.
            In the General Ledger the account code key flexfield has multiple structures
        The "Structure Column" field on the Flexfield Registration form sets this value
            For DFF's it is normally the ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY field (i.e. the context)
                The value of the ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY is set on the "Flexfield Segments" form
                It must point to another column on the same table where the DFF ATTRIBUTES exist
            For KFF's it is the field the application uses to switch structures
                e.g. For the account code KFF, it is the "Chart of Accounts" field
                    This Chart of Accounts is actually the KFF assigned in the Set of Books Defn.
            So for DFF's the structure used is determined by another column on the same table
                For KFF's it is driven by a setup in the application that may be on another table

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Descriptive Flexfields:
    Descriptive flexfields are found on Oracle Forms within [ ] brackets
        If they have values, you can partially see them inside the [ ] brackets
        They are implemented on database tables in ATTRIBUTE'1-15' fields
    DFF's also have Global Attributes stored in GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE'1-15'
        Global Attributes don't change based on context values (i.e. ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY)
        They are displayed alongside any context-sensitive flexfield segments on forms
    Descriptive flexfields are text flexfields that carry additional descriptive information
        They are used where no field is specifically available for it
    Descriptive flexfields are optional space for user-defined information
    There are thousands of pre-registered DFF's in the Oracle Applications
        Key Flexfields support dynamic insertion of new values in some cases but not all
            Dynamic insertion allows new combinations to be added on the fly
            Dynamic insertion adds values to a flexfield structure as transactions are created
                They do not have to be added through definition or setup forms
            Dynamic insertion must satisfy combination rules (cross validation rules)
                This is controlled in a checkbox in the flexfield structure definition form
    Descriptive Flexfields are intended for extra information to be stored
        Descriptive flexfields are implemented as ATTRIBUTE1..ATTRIBUTE15 on a table that supports them
            e.g. PO Headers supports descriptive flexfield values that allow user-defined fields on PO's
    DFF's can have contexts defined - each context changes the DFF segment definition and valid values
        So the structure and values in the DFF will be different depending on the context value
        Contexts are predefined or can include $PROFILES$.ORG_ID for operating unit organization
            You can also include the following
                $PROFILES$.MFG_ORGANIZATION_ID
                $PROFILES$.login_ID
                $PROFILES$.USER_ID
                $PROFILES$.USER_NAME
                $PROFILES$.CONCURRENT_REQUEST_ID
                $PROFILES$.GL_SET_OF_BKS_ID
                $PROFILES$.SO_ORGANIZATION_ID
                $PROFILES$.APPL_SHORT_NAME
                $PROFILES$.RESP_NAME
                $PROFILES$.RESP_ID
            These are the equivalent of embedding fnd_profile.value(.....) in a query
        If no context is predefined any environment variable will always work
    DFF Contexts can be assigned validation value sets but these value sets must observe restrictions in order to be selectable
        Reference
            https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18727_01/doc.121/e12892/T354897T361276.htm
        Format Type must be Character (Char)
        Numbers Only must not be checked (alphabetic characters are allowed)
        Uppercase Only must not be checked (mixed case is allowed)
        Right-justify and Zero-fill Numbers must not be checked
        If the validation type is Independent: the value set maximum size must be less than or equal to 30
    Default values can be assigned to Descriptive Flexfield segments
        Flexfield defaults can be defined as values or as SQL select statements
        SQL statements are similar to the select statement that might be used to define the corresponding value set
        Descriptive flexfields appear on forms as 'beer mugs' i.e. brackets '[ ]'
            They can be viewed and edited by clicking on them, or
            Choose Edit to display (Ctrl-E) the contents of the DFF
        Descriptive flexfield values are concatenated when displayed in the beer mug field
        Descriptive flexfields can be controlled and changed based on context
            They are only relevent or possible for certain types of records or value of other fields
    Each segment of a key flexfield and attribute of a descriptive flexfield are named
        They can have valid values as well as description fields for those values
        A single complete valid set of values for each segment in a flexfield is a 'combination'
    Exercise: Inquire on existing descriptive flexfields -> SA/Application/Descriptive/Segments
        and choose View/Find from the menu to list all applications and flexfield values

Flexfields and Value Sets (FND Schema) Notes on Concurrent Program Parameters
    The report parameters form used to enter report parameters is a descriptive flexfield form
        Report parameters are descriptive flexfield segments
        Segments are defined via Concurrent Program Definition and not via the Descriptive Flexfield Segments Window
        Valuess entered in concurrent requests are stored in the DFF segment of the FND_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS table
    $PROFILES$ or SQL Queries using FND_PROFILE.VALUE(Parameter) in SQL statements can be used in parameters
        Use ':$PROFILES$.ORG_ID' to reference the ORG_ID in SQL in table-validated value sets (the bind variable colon prefix is required)
        An example is $PROFILES$.ORG_ID (or FND_PROFILE.VALUE('ORG_ID') in SQL
            The full list of possible values for this environment variable are
                $PROFILES$.MFG_ORGANIZATION_ID

                Make program parameters dependent on prior values
        $FLEX$ is an environment variable which references selected values in flexfield value sets
        It can be used to create a dependent choice in a a list of parameters
        Until it is defined, it is null and the dependent parameters are greyed out

    R12.2 TOI: Implement and Use Application Object Library (AOL) - Flexfields Security and Separation of Duties for Value Sets (recorded training)

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Key Flexfields:
    Key flexfields are multi-segment values displayed as a combined single field on a form
        Key flexfields also have a popup display form allowing values to be shown separately
        They are implemented in SEGMENT'1-20' fields on tables
    Key flexfields are partitioned into multi-segment parts: from 1 to 20 segments
        The combined parts represent record keys: part numbers, account numbers etc
        Several applications require key flexfields to be configured for values
            These include account combinations, part numbers, location codes etc.
        Key flexfield segments are separated by a 'separator' character
            This character is user-defined in the flexfield definition
        Key flexfields are implemented in separate value tables as SEGMENT1..SEGMENT20
    Views are built when a KFF is compiled that store the concatenated fields
        These views shown in the "KFF Register" form and end in "_KFV"
        The name of the view table is created automatically when registry entry is made
    Key flexfields are segmented identifiers
        Each segment has a different meaning and rules for entry and range of values
    Flexfield qualifiers are names or tags for individual segments
        They tell an application where to look for needed information
            (e.g. natural account, or balancing segment, in the required GL accounting flexfield)
        Many qualifiers are required and must be assigned on segments prior to compilation
            Otherwise compilation will fail and generate an error message
        Access qualifiers of the segment definition form of a key flexfield structure
            You can only select qualifiers if the key flexfield supports them
    Key flexfields are required and unique identifiers
    Dynamic insertion allows key flexfield combinations to be added on the fly
    Key Flexfields can have Cross-Validation Rules (CVR) for value combinations that are valid
        Concurrent Program: 'Cross Validation Violation Report' ferrets out combinations which violate CVR's
        Cross-validation rules are active with dynamic insertion
        Cross-validation rules can be set up as EXCLUDE or INCLUDE rules
        Exercise: Create CVR's -> <Responsibility>/Flexfield/Key/CrossValidation
        Oracle recommends one all-inclusive rule followed by a number of exclude rules
            This avoid 'gaps' in the rules and avoids unintended excludes
        Adding a segment after flexfield cross-validation rules are defined will invalidate the rules
    Unique internal ID numbers are stored on the Oracle tables for each key flexfield combination
        The internal ID is used as the foreign key by other tables for a key flexfield combination
        So the flexfield is the outfacing value of the internal ID
    Every key flexfield has a combinations table that stores the segment values and corresponding internal ID
        For example the General Ledger/Accounting Key Flexfield uses GL_CODE_COMBINATIONS
        It stores all valid combinations for the GL code block (account combinations)
    Shorthand aliases can represent combinations of key flexfield values
        They are entered in the Alias window of the Flexfield definition
        The flexfield must be recompiled after aliases are defined
        All flexfield segment values must be established before aliases can be defined for valid combinations
    Changing a Key Flexfield once it has been setup and populated is difficult
        This is because Key Flexfields are embedded in tables as foreign key references.
        Changing these can involve complex conversion and risk, so planning is important
    You can search/query on key flexfields directly using wildcards and separators
        Use wildcards within separator patterns (e.g. "%.%.%.%" for a 4 segment flex query)
        You can also search by displaying the flexfield popup form and choosing 'Combinations'
    Flexfield segments have maximum length and display length parameters:
        if the display length is less than the maximum length, the field will scroll for data entry
    Dependent segments can be defined where ...
        The allowable values in one segment are dependent on the value in another segment
        This approach drives extra maintenance setting and updating valid segment relationships
    Segment names must be unique for key flexfields
        This is because KFF"s permit multiple structures
            Otherwise the flexfield will not compile properly
    Segment numbers in segment definitions indicate the relative position of the segment in the display forms
        Numbers can be 1, 2, 3 or 10, 20, 30 etc.
        Dependent segments should be numbered higher that the segments they depend upon
            This way they will appear after the segment that determines their scope of values
    Range values in a segment indicate if the segment value must be 'higher' or 'lower' than another segment ...
        in the flexfield with the same value set (eg from date and to date would be set up this way)
    Exercise: View an existing key flexfield registration -> Application Developer/Flexfield/Key/Register
    Exercise: Find an existing key flexfield -> System Admin/Application/Key/Flexfield/Segments and query the application
    Exercise: Create a key flexfield -> SA/Application/Key/Flexield/Segments
        and query by entering an application name
        Optionally add a flexfield name to the query to avoid paging through all flexfields for the application
        Or query back all values and page down at the header level to step through the applications and flexfields
    Exercise: Define segments for a key flexfield -> SA/Application/Key/Flexield/Segments
        and query a flexfield structure
        Then click the 'Open' button with a segment row highlighted
    Exercise: Define shorthand aliases for key flexfields -> SA/Application/Flexfields/Key/Aliases
        and query the flexfield to establish the alias, such as an account alias

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Defining a Key FlexField Structure
    The setup required for a KFF is normally limited to creating structures for existing KFF's
        Registration of the KFF is not required when additional structures are being added
    Establish Values Sets for the segments in the KFF
        Exercise: Create a Value Set -> <Responsibility>/Application/Validation/Set
        Exercise: Create values for the Value Set -> <Responsibility>/Validation/Values
    Define the segment structure for the Key Flexfield
        Exercise: Define a structure for an existing KFF -> <Application Developer>/Flexfield/Key/Segments
            Query the existing application and KFF values (e.g. "General Ledger" and "Accounting Flexfield)"
            Assign Value Sets to the Segments
            Assign all required segment qualifiers (otherwise compilation will fail)
        Freeze the flexfield structure definition and compile the flexfield
    Add cross-validation rules to the new KFF structure definition
    Assign aliases for the valid keyflexfield combinations
        Exercise: Create CVR's -> <Responsibility>/Flexfield/Key/CrossValidation

        to assign a security rule to a responsibility
    Flexfield security rules are sets of exclusion rules assigned to responsibilities
        Each set of rules is bundled into a named rule group.
        The rule group is attached to the responsibility definition
            So a user with the responsibility cannot enter or see the excluded combinations
    Security rules can be defined for flexfield values to limit what a user can enter
        It also limits what query results for existing records
    An example of flexfield security rules is General Ledger security
        GL responsibilities are tied to Sets of Books to limit access to these Sets of Books
        GL responsibilities are also tied to Security Rules to limit access to accounts
            This is used to limit which companies a user can see in a single set of books
        In R12 Data Access Set security overlaps Security Rules
            Security Rules limit access based on the Balancing Segment or Management Segment only

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Important Key Flexfields:
    Oracle General Ledger - Accounting Key Flexfield
    Fixed Assets - Asset Category, Asset Key, Asset Location
    Inventory - Item Key
    Human Resources - Positions and Jobs

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Value Sets:
    Value Sets are lists of values that can be applied to flexfield segments
        Note that for KFF's dynamic insertion will allow new values at the time of entry
    A Value Set is a set of valid values that can be attached to a report parameter
        It can also be attached to a field for validation and selection
    Value Sets can be independent or dependent
        A dependent Value Set is based on a prior segment value in flexfield
    Value Sets are otherwise known as QuickPick values.
    The display mode for Value Sets can be LOV, long list of values, and POP list.
        This is set through the "List Type" on the Value Set definition form
    Value Sets can be lists of values, or they can be defined as SELECT clauses on other tables
    Value Sets can also be used to store custom values
        This avoids developing custom tables or custom forms to maintain custom values
        The value sets are preserved through upgrades without special measures.
    Value Sets and values are stored in FND_FLEX_VALUE_SETS, FND_FLEX_VALUES.
    The Value Set tables are joined by a flex_value_set_id and flex_value_id.
    One Value Set can be assigned any number of times in the applications
        Value Set assignments can be to one or more segments in one or more flexfields in any applications
    A Value Set can contain a set of values and corresponding set of descriptions
        The values and descriptions are searchable in a lookup list
    Values in these sets have descriptions corresponding to values to better define them
        These name/value pairs are maintained through the 'Values' form
    Value Sets have validation types:
        independent- a user-maintained list of values (independent of other segment data)
        dependent - a user-maintainied list dependent on a value in a prior segment
        special- a range of values within another list of values
        none - only length and format restrictions are provided
        table - a query against values in another table is defined
        pair - used for request submission parameters
        translatable-independent - same as an independent value set, but with language translation
        translatable-dependent - same as a dependent value set, but with language translation
    A Value Set's length must be no longer than the length of the flexfield segment it is assigned to.
    The individual values in a Value Set cannot be changed once they are used
        However their descriptions can be changed.
    To edit values: hide old values (which may already be in use) and add new values
    Table validations can be set up for any existing table (or by creating and registering a new table
        Define the Value Set and choose Table Validation to get access to the table validation form
    Value Sets can have their own descriptive flexfields that are context sensitive
        You can define flexfields to value set values and associate additional value sets to these flexfields
    To see context sensitive descriptive flex field values in the Value Set flexfield
        (i.e.) look at the DFF's on value sets -
        query DFF's for the "Application Object Library" application
            using the description "Flexfield Segment Values"
    Value Set setup forms are accessible from many responsibilities across all applications
    Exercise: Create a Value Set for a flexfield -> <Responsibility>/Application/Validation/Set
    Exercise: Create values for a valueset -> <Responsibility>/Application/Validation/Values
        find the Value Set already defined ('find values by Value Set')
    Exercise: Create a table definition for a valueset -> <Responsibility>/Application/Validation/Set
        set the validation type to 'Table', then choose 'edit information'

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Value Set Setup Steps:
    Define Value Sets and values using almost any setup responsibility
    Exercise: Open the Value Set Definition -> <Responsibility>/Application/Validation/Set
        List Type: Can be Poplist (< 10 values), List (11 - 200 values), Long List (> 200 values)
        Maximum Size: This is the number of characters for the chosen format type (eg Char)
    Exercise: Create values for the Value Set -> <Responsibility>/Validation/Values
        Enter values and descriptions

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Profile Options:
    "Flexfields:Open Desc Window" - defaults to open a DFF automatically when focus is set
    "Flexfields:Shorthand Entry" - turns on short hand alias entries for key flexfields
    "Flexfields:Autoskip" - skips focus to the next field on complete entry, without tabbing
    "Flexfields:Show Full Value" - displays the key flexfield edit window after the alias window closes

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Key Tables:
    FND_ID_FLEXS - is a registry of key flex fields
    FND_ID_FLEX_SEGMENTS - defines the segments within each key flexfield
    FND_ID_FLEX_STRUCTURES - defines the structures for each key flexfield
    FND_FLEX_VALIDATION_RULES - cross-validation rules
    FND_FLEX_VALUES (and _TL) - contains the actual values and their hierarchy level
    FND_FLEX_VALUE_SETS - stores the values set headers
    FND_FLEX_VALIDATION_TABLES - validation rules for table based validations
    FND_FLEX_VALUES (and _TL) - stores the actual values within each value set
        This table supports language translation
    GL_CODE_COMBINATIONS - stores actual combinations for the General Ledger Account codes
    FND_FLEX_VALUE_HIERARCHIES - stores the parent values and all ranges detail level ranges for those parent
        You can query on a detailed account within a range and return all parents at all levels
        This table is denormalized to show all detail level ranges (at most detail level) for all parents at all levels
    FND_FLEX_VALUE_NORM_HIERARCHY - stores each parent and it's range in fully normalized format
        Each record appears as you enter it online - one record for each parent at each level with it's immediate children

Flexfields and Value Sets (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Frequently Asked Questions
    How is it possible to have multiple structures for the same Key Flexfield title?
        Applications such as General Ledger support them
        e.g. Each Set of Books can have a different accounting key flexfield
        e.g. Each Item Inventory Organization can have a different Item Key Flexfield
        So multiple key flexfield structures can be defined under the same flexfield title
    How is it possible to have multiple structures for the same Descriptive Flexfield?
        Descriptive Flexfields have a context field which acts as a switch between structures
        Different applications support using different contexts
        e.g. Invoice Source in AP can be linked to a Context Field
            Different Invoice Sources utilize different DFF structures on invoices
        This allows overloading of DFF fields with multiple definitions
        It extends the ability of a DFF to store values relevant to different transactions
    How can two different flexfield structures use common segment columns on the same table?
        For Key Flexfields, the structure that is used depends on how the application is setup
            Only one KFF structure is used on a single transaction
        For Descriptive Flexfields, the structure that is used depends upon the context
            Only one DFF structure is used on a single transaction
    How do the applications know which FlexField Structure to use
        That's the role of the "Structure Column" field in the Flexfield Registration entry
        The "Structure Column" is a table column used to decide which structure to use
        See the "Register" form for this value
        For DFF's it is normally set to the ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY field (the Context field)
        For KFF's it is normally set to the column in the code combinations table established for the purpose
            e.g. Account Code Combinations actually use the KFF Structure column
                This value is tied into the table through the Set of Books setup definition
    Where do flexfield qualifiers come from and how are they defined and assigned special behaviours?
        Flexfield Qualifiers are defined by the Applications
        Different functions within the applications operate on these qualifiers
        e.g. An Intercompany Segment qualifier is used by Inter Company accounting functions
    Why can't Key Flexfield definitions be changed?
        DFF's can ) but KFF's cannot if they have been used.
            Once a KFF is used, its primary key is a foreign key embedded in other tables

FNDLoad or "Generic Loader" (FNDLOAD in APPLSYS Schema) General Notes
    Reference information on FNDLOAD is in the Systems Administration Guide in the 'Loaders' section
    The FNDLOAD utility is a generic loader that can upload or download application objects
        The concurrent program is 'Generic Loader'
    FNDLOAD is a concurrent program run from inside Oracle
    Data is downloaded to a file (.ldt) using a configuration control file (.lct) and uploaded using a config control file (.lct)
    The loader operates in download mode (to a text file) or upload mode (from text file)
    The .ldt file is human readable and editable by any text editor - information normally stored as codes is translated to short-names
    Foundation Loader exports foundation functional security and user setup values to a text file or imports values from a text file
    The Foundation Loader text file is easily readable and can be edited between the export and import
    The import loader updates existing rows, inserts new rows and leaves existing rows unchanged (unless there are updates)
    FNDLOAD is also known as 'Generic Loader' in Oracle terminology
        'Generic Loader' is the description assigned to FNDLOAD in the executable
            description in Oracle Applications
    FNDLOAD is a concurrent program located at $FND_TOP/bin
    It can move data across application instances using data file representions
    It downloads data from the database using a control file .ct.
        It creates a data file .ldt which is a plain text file and portable across hosts
        The .lct file is predefined by Oracle and saved at $FND_TOP/patch/115/import.
        Custom configuration .lct files can be placed in the same location

    Limitations of Forms Personalization (Doc ID 420518.1)
    Information About the Oracle Applications Form Personalization Feature in 11i (Doc ID 279034.1)

Forms Personalization (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    Forms Personalization allows changes to Oracle Forms including:
        Changing titles on fields
        Hiding fields and re-arranging fields
        Making fields non-editable
        Adding validations and error messages
        Adding local captions on forms
        Setting field defaults
        Adding links from a form to other forms
    Forms personalization was originally implemented through CUSTOM.PLL library coding
        CUSTOM.PLL handles triggers on a range of events generated by Oracle Forms
    Forms personalization applies to Oracle Forms and not J2EE webpages
        Web page customization is covered by the Oracle Applications Framework
    It works in front of CUSTOM.PLL so both methods of personalization can co-exist
    With 11.5.10 these same customizations are implemented as metadata that is admin-user configurable
    The configurations in Forms Personalization are protected through upgrades
    FNDLOAD scripts are provided to move these setups between different instances of applications
        See notes on FNDLOAD

Forms Personalization (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on the Procedure to Change a Form:
    Personalizations are configured through the help menu on any existing Oracle form
        Exercise: customize a form -> Open the Form in 11i10, and
            choose Help/Diagnostics/Custom Code/Personalize
    The steps to create a personalization are:
        Run the form to be personalized (i.e. display it)
        Invoke the Personalization Screen via Help/Diagnostics/Custom Code/Personalize
        Create rules that determine when the personalization will be triggered
            All forms have a standard event list that provide candidates for the trigger
            Conditional expressions can be attached to the trigger to limit invocation
        Define the context for the trigger to specify who the rule applies to
            Context can be Site, Responsibility, User or Industry
            The rule will be executed if the current running context matches the definition
        Create the actions that will be invoked
            One or more actions can be defined
            The action can be associated with a single language or run for all languages
    Personalizations comprise Conditions ("if-then-else" like conditions) and Actions
    There is a central form for turning off all personalizations
        This shuts down unidentified errors that may arise in personalizations

Forms Personalization (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Note on Procedure to Enable View Output
    General
        Function: FND_FNDCPQCR_SYS
        Form Name: FNDRSRUN
    Condition
        Trigger Event: WHEN-NEW-RECORD-INSTANCE
        Trigger: JOBS
        Processing Mode: Not in Enter-Query Mode
    Context
        Level: Responsibility
        Value: System Administrator
        Sequence: 1
        Description: Allow View Output
        Level: Function
    Actions
        Sequence: 1
        Type: Property
        Language: All
        Object Type: Item
        Target Object: JOBS.VIEW_REPORT
        Property Name: ENABLED
        Value: TRUE

Forms Personalization (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Hidden Form Events:
    There is an event ON_VALIDATE_ITEM that is not in the list of events
        This event does not allow selection of the item from the LOV for items
        As a workaround, click on the form field you want before opening the personalization form
        This sets focus to the item you want behind the scenes

Forms Personalization (AOL FND APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Profile Options:
    Utilities:Diagnostics - set to Yes to eliminate prompt for an APPS password
        This profile option is cached so you have to log off and close browser sessions then restart

General Ledger (GL) Best Practices:
    Dependent segments on the accounting KFF should be avoided
       This is due to ongoing maintenance
       Use parent segments, summary accounts, rollup groups and FSG calculations used instead
    Use a Group ID on all GL uploades from ADI and enforce it through the 'GLDI Create Group ID' profile option

Accounting Setup Manager (GL) Table of Contents
    Accounting Setup Manager is a central setup dashboard for configuring ledger, legal entities and companies
    It also supports configuration of processing options for the General Ledger and related functionality
    Navigation: AP Superuser > Setup > Accounting Setups > Ledger Setup > Define > Accounting Setups

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Account Segments, Account Structure and Account Combinations:
    Natural accounts are qualified by type: asset, liability, owner's equity, revenue or expense. These qualifiers apply to the segment in the AFF that is designated the natural account segment
    Segment qualifiers at the highest level are: natural account (required), balancing segment (required), cost center (optional) ,inter-company, and management (optional - R12)
    After modifying segments (e.g. end-dating) you need to run 'Program - Inherit Segment Value Attributes' to update settings on code combinations
        This program 'Program - Inherit Segment Value Attributes' updates all segments in gl.gl_code_combinations that have the updated segment value
            If you update an account segment, all entries for all books for this account value are updated, regardless of the set of books
            Only code combinations in the same chart of accounts are updated
    Exercise: Disable an account code combination -> GLVO/Setups/Accounts/Combinations, query the range of accounts code combinations to review, and uncheck the 'Enabled' checkbox against each account code combination. Save.
    Exercise: Set an Account Combination Effective Date Range -> GLVO/Setups/Accounts/Combinations, and query the range of account code combinations to review, and set the effective dates for each row of valid account code combinations. Save.
    Exercise: Disable an Specific Account Segment Value (for all combinations) -> GLVO/Setup/Financials/Flexfields/Key/Value, and find values by key flexfield (segment). Uncheck the 'Enabled' checkbox for the segment value, and save.

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on the Accounting Flexfield:
    Accounting Key Flexfield - establishes the structure of the chart of accounts segments
    The account code combination flexfield length determines the lowest level of reporting and balances in the GL
    A balancing segment is required in the account flexfield to balance the total for journals (total DR's = total CR's for each balancing value)
       The balancing segment is the segment against which a balance sheet is prepared
       It is also used to generate a trial balance
    A cost center segment is required if FA, PA or other modules are implemented
    The accounting flexfield is difficult to change once it has been compiled and used. Changes could create data inconsistancies    Can be up to 30 segments but typically 3 to 6 (min would be company/department or cost center/account)
    Min segments are 2 (one balancing segment and one natural account segment)
    The intercompany segment is a separate segment that is stamped with the company id for the 'other company' in an intercompany journal.
        This provided a control total since the DR's/CR's for all intercompany journal entries for all companies should balance within a period.
        It also allows a company to track the source of a journal posted from another company.
        Note the 'Balance Intercompany' flag must be set on the SOB Definition form to force balancing entries to be created
    The Management Segment (R12) is optional and is used to restrict access by users with Data Access Sets
        It can be assigned to any segment except the Balancing Segment or the Natural Account
    Flexfield segment examples are: COMPANY -> Operations, Distribution, Corporate, etc, DEPARTMENT -> East, West, Computing, etc, ACCOUNT -> Cash, AR, WIP, Assets, Cost of Sales, Expenses, etc, SUBACCOUNT: California, Kansas, Idaho etc, PRODUCT -> Keyboard, Monitor, Stand, etc,
    Exercise: Define flexfield values -> Setup/Flexfields/Key/Values and find 'Oracle General Ledger'

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Segment Value Inheritance
    Run 'Program - Inherit Segment Value Attributes' to update all code combinations with attributes of the account segment
       Values such as Active, Inactive, Start Date, End Date etc are propogated
       Account Type is not propagated by segment value inheritance and must be updated via script
    You can protect an existing code combination from inheriting updates by checking the 'Preserve' check box
    The process is fully documented in the GL User Guide

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Accounting Calendars and Periods:
    The intercompany balancing segment is new to 11i
        it automatically stamps intercompany journals with the partner company id so that each company can add up total intercompany debits and credits and balance with the other companies
        Note the 'Balance Intercompany' flag must be set on the SOB Definition form to force balancing entries to be created
    Periods are defined in calendars by names and non-overlapping date ranges.
    An adjustment period for year-end adjustments can overlap date ranges
        The adjustment period is typically the last day of the year and is opened when all other periods are closed, to post adjustments before year end close is completed
    Accounting periods are opened one at a time through a concurrent process - triggered from the Open/Close form in the setup menu
        Periods that are open for entry only mean there are no lines on GL_BALANCES and posting cannot occur
        When a period is opened the new period balance lines are created in GL_BALANCES
            Journals can be posted to the new period because the lines exist in GL_BALANCES to update
    Accounting periods should be opened 'earliest first' since opening the first period locks all prior periods out
        If prior periods are locked out historical data cannot be converted
    Multiple periods can remain open at the same time
        However periods should be closed when no longer used to avoid transactions being posted incorrectly
    Encumbrance periods are opened one year at a time through the same form as accounting periods - Open/Close form in setup
    Accounting periods can be reopened but will invalidate past financial statements - prior period adjustments in current journals are preferred
    Exercise: Open an accounting period -> GLVO/Setup/Open-Close.
        Click on 'Open Next Period' button - form shows most recent open period. Kicks off concurrent process
    Exercise: Close an accounting period -> GLVO/Setup/Open-Close.
        Choose period to close and select 'Closed' from LOV. Save the change. You can also choose 'Permanently Closed' from the same LOV
    Exercise: Define Period Types -> GL Superuser/Setup/Financial/Calendars/Types - to define period types like month, quarter, year
    Exercise: Define Calendars (Calendar Periods) ->
        GENERAL LEDGER/Setup/Financial/Calendars/Accounting
            to define a calendar and it's accounting periods
        Note that the 'NAME' column is generated by Oracle using the 'PREFIX' and year
            The year is taken from the year in the 'FROM' date
            This 'NAME' column is generated automatically after the 'FROM' year is entered
    Exercise: Open Periods -> Setup/Open-Close and set focus on the line and click 'Open Next Period'
        open the earliest needed period first during setup, for historical entries

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Security Rules
    Security Rules are applied to Key Flexfields and not limited to the General Ledger
    See 'Flexfields and Value Sets' for in this document for more information

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Data Access Sets (introduced in R12)
    Data Access Sets restrict access to GL data based on Balancing Segment and Management Segment rules
        Functionality overlaps Security Rules which limit access based on any segment in the Accounting Key Flexfield
    Reports (available under the General Ledger Super User)
        'Data Access Set Listing' lists all data access sets sharing the responsibility chart of accounts

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Definition Access Sets (introduced in R12):
    There are several features of Definition Access Sets that must be observed when defining them
        They operate cumulatively at the user level and not the responsibility level
            If a user has definition privilege access under any responsibility this access will be enabled under all responsibilities
            Definitions are not restricted by responsibility for a single user but enabled under all resposibilities
        You cannot enable security on an entity without assigning at least one Definition Access Set
        You cannot assign a definition access set to an entity unless it has already been assigned to a responsiblity
            Each definition access set must be assigned to at least one responsibility before it will appear in a drop down list
            So create definition access sets (without member entities) and assign them to a responsibility before beginning the entity assignment process
        You also cannot assign a Definition Entity to a Definition Access Set if you don't have the corresponding responsibility
            This is one of the responsibilities the Definition Access Set is assigned to
        You cannot assign a Definition Access Set to an underlying Entity with no permissions for viewing, using or updating
            i.e. you cannot remove all privileges from a Definition Access Set assignment to an underlying entity.
            Simply do not assign the Definition Access Set to the responsibility and the responsibility will have no privileges (or remove the assignment)
    You can setup a Definition Access Set with members and subsequently delete all the members but it can create a problem
        If the entity is already secured by a definition access set and the DAS members are deleted, the entity becomes unreachable
            i.e. it is 'secured' but has no Definition Access Sets assigned (this is a design flaw)
    Setup steps are:
        Create a Definition Access Set Without Member Assignments to Secured Entities
            Navigation: GL Superuser > Setup > Definition Access Sets > Define
                Enter a Definition Access Set Name and Description
            You cannot create secured member entities here unless entities have already been tagged as secured
            If entities have not been tagged as secured, the member entities are created later when the entities are defined and secured(see step below)
        Assign the Definition Access Set to Responsibilities
            This must be done to at least one responsibility before the Definition Access Set can be used
            Navigation: GL Superuser > Setup > Definition Access Sets > Assign
        Assign the Definition Access Set to the Entity Being Created by Navigating to the Definition form for the entity
            Navigation (e.g. Revaluation) GL Controller > Currency > Revaluation > (Query Revaluation Rule Set or Enter New)
            Check the 'Enable Security' box to enable the 'Assign Access' button on the screen
            Click 'Assign Access' and add the Definition Access Set to the list of assignees (and save to trigger compilation)
                The compilation program is 'Compile Definition Access Sets'
        Requery the Definition Access Set to Confirm the Assignments
    Definition Access Set Reports (under GL Superuser)
        'Other - Definition Access By User - shows cumulative access to all entities across all responsibilities for a single user
        'Other - Definition Access Set Listing' lists definition privileges for a single definition access set and entity type (e.g. revaluation)

                 e.g. Net DR account is less than Net DR so DR account requires a balancing entry - use CR account
             If you use All Other on either or both sides of the rule

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Month-End (Period-End) Processing:
    You can open and close individual Ledgers using the Open/Close form
    Close the period once all transactions are booked and adjustments made
        This must be done for each set of books in 11.5.10 but can be done for Ledger Sets in R12
    Close for Ledgers or Ledger Sets can be done with concurrent programs
        Periods - Close Periods
        Periods - Gapless Close Periods - can only be done by concurrent program
            This close stamps gapless reporting sequences on all transactions (see Reporting Sequences)
        Periods - Permanently Close Periods

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Year End Close Processing:
    Close Year-End by opening the first period of the new year
        resets income statement accounts to zero and books retained earnings to the ledger
    After Year-End Close journals posted to a prior year automatically adjust the retained earnings account balance
        The adjustment reflects the net change in income and expenses
    Accounting dates use the occurrance date and not the entry date for a transaction
        transactions are accounted in the periods when they actually occurred.
    Accounting periods and start and end dates are completely flexible
        However the number of periods must be the same from year to year for comparison reporting purposes
            This is enforced by Oracle

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Entering and Maintaining Currencies
    Exchange rates can be entered in several ways:
        through Currency Rates Manager by direct entry
        through Currency Rates Manager by spreadsheet upload
        through the Currency Rates Maintenance form
    Oracle automatically calculates inverse rates so inverse rates do not need to be entered in each line
    Exercise: Enter currency rates -> GL Superuser/Setup/Currencies/Rates/Daily
    Exercise: Upload currency rates -> GL Superuser/Setup/Currency Rates Manager/Daily Rates

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Multiple Reporting Currencies (MRC's):
    MRC is a feature in Oracle that allows reporting and records maintenance in more than one currency at the transactional level
    Multiple Reporting Currencies (MRC) are implemented through additional 'reporting' sets of books in the GL
        these books have alternate currency definitions (see form 'Assign Reporting Sets of Books' form)
        Navigation -> <General Ledger Super User>/Setup/Financial/Books/Assign
        A reporting set of books is defined by setting the 'Reporting' radio button on the SOB definition form (MRC Tab)
    When a journal is entered in a currency different to the SOB functional currency:
        The system uses the exchange rate specified in the journal header to convert to the functional currency
        The journal is posted to GL_BALANCES with updates for each currency (two records in GL_BALANCES for the same set of books)
        This includes updating the 'BEQ' suffix fields on the foreign currency line and
            updating the entered values on the line representing the functional currency
        The functional currency line in GL_BALANCES represents the cumulative balance of functional currency entries and foreign currency entries
            This means you can only get the functional currency entered amounts by backing out the BEQ amounts on the foreign currency lines.
            It also means that the functional currency lines on the GL_BALANCES table represent the total balances for all currencies.
        The foreign currency lines in GL_BALANCES only represent the foreign currency amounts and their corresponding functional currency values
        GL then checks for reporting sets of books (using triggers on the GL_BALANCES tabe) and if it finds them
            GL automatically converts entered journals to the alternate currencies and then posting to the alternate reporting set of books
                so every transaction in the primary set of books is mirrored in the reporting set of books in the different currency
    Reporting sets of books in the GL have the same calendar and chart of accounts as the primary set of books
        they simply have a different currency.
    A separate reporting responsibility must be defined to access the reporting set of books.
        This is done by associating two profile options to a responsibility:
            GL: Set of Books Name
            GL: Reporting Set of Books
    Subledger transactions track MRC values using MRC 'subtables' for all the subledger applications:
        Cash Management,
        Cost Management,
        Global Accounting Engine,
        Payables,
        Receivables,
        Purchasing and
        Projects (ie all the subledgers)
    In the subledgers, MRC is implemented with MRC subtables that are populated by a trigger on the main tables
        to calculate and store the converted currency transaction values
    The reporting set of books is a fully functional GL for:
        transacting,
        inquiring and reporting directly,
        recording of adjustments
    Currency conversion rates can be maintained for different types.
        Seeded currency types are Corporate, Spot and User
        The currency type 'Revaluation' is also supported for a special revaluation rate (optional)
    MRC requirements come from several sources:
        foreign currency transactions (import/export),
        currency gains and losses,
        operations in foreign countries,
        consolidating foreign operations, and
        Euro activities
    Functional currency is the currency for the majority of transactions and the currency for reporting
        foreign exchange transactions are converted to functional currency
    Oracle posts the converted (functional) currency and the foreign currency to the ledger in the joural entry.
        GL maintains both currencies for future revaluations, gain and loss calculations and reporting
    Exchange rates are maintained in the GL and can be one of several types: daily, average, usage and period end
        Daily rates are used to convert transactions at the time they are entered.
        Average rates are used to compare operating results over a time period.
        Period-end rates are used to convert balances for consolidation
    Gains and losses in foreign exchange for export sales arise
        This is due to a change in the conversion rate from the time of invoice to the time of payment.
    Revaluation changes balance sheet accounts that become misstated due to fluctuations in exchange rates
        (eg receivables, payables, assets).
        A gain or loss account is posted with the change in valuation, as an unrealized amount
    Revaluation journals are posted at month-end close and reversed for the opening of the next month.
        This more fairly states the closing accounts at month end.
        Actual gains and losses are posted when the accounts are settled (eg invoice paid)
    Balance translation is used to consolidate foreign entity books using one of two methods:
        equity translation and
        temporal translation.
        Only one method can be chosen in compliance with FAS 52 standards
    Equity translation treats the foreign subsidiary as an investment and the equity is valued at market rates for inclusion in local books
    Temporal translation converts each account on the balance sheet according to it's timing
        (cash at current rates, fixed assets at date of acquisition etc).
        There is a TRANSLATED_FLAG on GL.GL_BALANCES that indicates if the line has been translated
            If 'Y' it means the balance is translated, based on the functional currency balance
            If 'N' it means the balance is translated, but out of date and needs re-translation
    GL supports reporting in Euro currency denominations as well as local currencies concurrently,
        to support the dual currency transition period to the Euro
    Transacting in Euros and reporting in Euros are independent objectives within GL and supported differently,
        because their timing is different.
    Inflationary countries set up USD as an MRC reporting set of books
        This provides reporting in a meaningful currency denomination

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Summary Templates
    Warning - avoid defining templates that break security rules
        For example if you set the Balancing Segment to 'T' it will break security rules on the Balancing Segment
        Avoid this by setting the Balancing Segment to 'D' or creating a rollup group on the balancing segment value
            Then include the rollup group in the template definition - this will prevent Oracle attempting to roll up secured segments
    Warning - adding templates can take a long time - assign the process to a separate manager if needed
    Templates are representations of account ranges where some segments are summarized and others shown in detail
    Navigation: <General Ledger Superuser>/Setup/Accounts/Summary
    Use 'T' or 'D' for Total or Detail to rollup or leave detailed accounts for summarization
    Also use fixed values to create very specific templates (e.g. include the actual company code in the template for the balancing segment)
    Additional valid values are rollup groups within each segment
    Once created and saved, a concurrent process is spawned to build a definition of the template for use in GL inquiry and reporting
        The definition is built on GL.GL_BALANCES by creating summary balances with new summary code combinations
    To delete a template and recreate it, delete the summary template entry from the form and save.
        The template will show 'deleting' status and start a concurrent process when saved
    Templates are stored on GL.GL_SUMMARY_TEMPLATES

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Summary Accounts and Rollup Groups:
    Navigation: <General Ledger Superuser>/Setup/Finanicals/Flexfields/Key/Groups (to create rollup groups)
    Navigation: <General Ledger Superuser>/Setup/Financials/Flexfields/Values (to assign rollup group names to segment values)
    Navigation: <General Ledger Superuser>/Setup/Financials/Flexfields/Values (to create summary Summary Segments and hierarchies)
    Rollup Groups are summary level values that attach to segment summary values in value sets
        There is a separate form for defining rollup groups and another form (key flex segment values defn) for assigning rollup groups
        Rollup Groups can only be assigned to parent values in segment hierarchies - they cannot be assigned to child values
    Rollup groups be applied to the segment in an accounting key flexfield
    The overall structure can be viewed in the Hierarchy Manager window (a Java applet)
        Navigation: <General Ledger Superusr>/Setup/Accounts/Manager (to view the Account Hierarchy manager)
        To allow changes in Account Hierarchy Manager, set the profile option 'GL AHM: Allow Users to Modify Hierarchy' to Yes
        To allow changes to Rollup Groups in Account Hierarchy Manager, the Key Flex Structure must be unfrozen first
            Otherwise the needed action buttons will not display.
            You create new rollup groups or change existing rollup groups in the rollup group window
            You change the assignments of rollup groups to parent accounts by viewing the properties (right-click) of the account
            You cannot change properties directly in the spreadsheet displays.
    Segment Summaries are parent values in the LOV hierarchy for a segment LOV
        Segment Summaries are attached to ranges of child values
        Roll up Groups are not attached to child ranges - they attach to any values at any level across the entire hierarchy
    Both Rollup Groups and Segment Hiearchies are defined in the Segment Values and Child Ranges dialog of Key Flex Segment Definition
    Multiple rollup groups on GL account segments are used to produce management summaries.
        You can define a hierarchy of parents and children for each account flexfield segment
    Summary accounts cross all segments in the Accounting Flexfield
        They can total designated segments and provide detail values on other segments
    Summary accounts totalling is designated in a template using 'T' for total the segment, or 'D' meaning keep segment detail
    Summary accounts provide online account balances, regardless of the values of non-account flexfield segments.
        Summary accounts are defined in the Setup/Accounts/Summary form
        Also create a value in the value set for each segment as 'T' to avoid errors querying balances in accounts (the segment value 'T' must exist)
            Note: the value set on the segment must allow non-numeric values to do this.
        Once the summary account combinations are defined and the 'T' values defined in each segment where needed, query GL balances
            Enter the summary account pattern (e.g. T.D.D.D.D.D) and enter values or ranges for the 'D' segments and run the query
        Use the Optimizer
            References: How To Improve Overall Performance of General Ledger Application ? (Doc ID 143196.1)
            The optimizer concurrent program 'GL: Optimizer' creates indexes on segment values to improve posting performance
            The 'Maintain Summary Templates' program updates summary templates for new accounts that have been added to the chart
    Parent-child relationships group individual value set values into summary or parent values
        This is all within the single segment and as part of their value set (value set hierarchy)
    Parent segment values are part of the value set, and their children are linked in the Account Hierarchy Editor form via ADI
    Parents can have parents in a multi-level hierarchy, and one child can be linked under multiple different parents
    Parent totals are calculated as they are needed
        They are not updated continuously and are therefore not available for online inquiry
    Rollup groups work like summary accounts but they are not continously calculated
        they summarize values across multiple segments
    Roll-up groups are independent of value set parents in accounting flexfields and group value set parents for further summarization
    Roll-up groups do rollups across all segments of the accounting flexfield, whereas parents/children in value sets remain within a segment
    Account should be grouped into meaningful ranges to accomodate range parameters in reports such as FSG's
    Account Generator builds accounts for a limited list of feeder transactions only: Projects Supplier Invoices, Projects Employee Expense Lines, Purchase Orders, Requisitions, AR Finance Charges, Asset Depreciation and Asset Additions, Inventory/Order Management Cost of Goods Sold
    Account Generator workflows are associated with AFF flexfields in the AFF flexfield definition - see SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR/Application/Flexfield/Key/Account for the Account Generator Processes form

    Sales accounts from Order Management are built by AutoAccounting in 11i, not Account Generator

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Journals and Recurring Journals:
    References: Metalink Note: 138199.1 Oracle General Ledger Journal Entry Setup and Usage
    Journal sources define where a journal comes from (feeder system, manual input in place of automated interface etc)
    Journal categories define the business purpose of the journal such as payroll costs, cash disbursements, depreciation etc
        Journal categories are not dependent on set of books - they apply to all sets of books when they are setup
    Journal balance types can be actual, budget or encumbrance
    Journal batches are sets of related journals that are posted at the same time
    A journal is a set of journal lines that balance such that total debits and credits are equal.
    Journals are entered and posted in separate steps, from multiple sources: manual entry into GL, journal import interface or ADI upload
    Recurring journals are journal definitions, that can be 'generated' multiple times for different accounting periods. The accounting period is specified when you generate the journal.
    Autopost will post journals automatically on a recurring schedule using journal selection criteria: source, category (purpose), period and balance type
    Journals can be entered out of balance if a balancing account is specified on the set of books to post the variance
    Journals can be imported through the standard GL import process for Oracle subledgers and third party systems. Suspense tranasactions can be corrected, or deleted, or reprocessed (eg. after opening a d period)
    Journals can be imported into 'Open' periods or 'Future Enterable' periods but cannot be posted for future enterable periods.
    Journals can be imported in summary mode (one line per unique AFF combination) or detail mode (one line for every source line)
    Suspense accounts can be defined for journals to post imbalances, rather than require journals to be balanced prior to posting.
        They can be defined for a journal category and journal source combination
    Consolidations between SOB's on different instances use GL import to post consolidation journals.
        GIS contains this functionality including approval by owners of each instance SOB
    Journal import can be used to load opening balances to the ledger as an opening journal import set
    Posting involved applying each journal line to update the corresponding journal balance and setting the POSTED field on GJ_JE_LINES to 'Yes'
    Posting actual journals update balances rolling forward to the end of the most recent open period
    Security rules attached to responsibilities further restrict account access beyond the Set of Books level
        part of accounting flexfield definition and responsibility definition
    Cross validation rules block out invalid AFF combinations. For asset/liability accounts, Department is typically zero.
    Segments in the AFF should be independent of each other, with valid and invalid combinations
    Existing account combinations can be disabled to prevent further posting of journals
    Every journal entry has a descriptive flexfield segment where additional detail about the journal line or entry can be stored (eg source document number)
    Global Consolidation System (GCS) can be used to interface legacy subledgers to the Oracle General Ledger, utilizing it's multiple SOB capability and account mapping functions
    Exercise: Find a journal -> GLVO/Journals/Enter, displays 'Find Journals' form. Enter find criteria and click 'find'.
        Use Posting Status to find unposted journals. Click 'Review Journal' from next form of returned values, to view detailed journal
    Exercise: Refine a search for a journal -> click flashlight on 'Find Journals' form
    Exercise: Review journal detail (1) -> 'Review Journal' from the 'Enter Journals' form
    Exercise: Review journal detail (2) -> Journals/Enter, then 'Review Batch' then 'Journals'
    Exercise: Review journal detail (3) -> Inquiry/Journal' then enter find criteria
    Exercise: Enter a journal -> GLVO/Journals/Enter, then 'New Journal' or 'New Batch'
    Exercise: Post a journal -> GLVO/Journals/Enter. Choose unposted journal from the 'Find' dialog, then 'Review Batch', 'More Actions', and 'Post' review the journal contents and subsequently post the journal. 'Requery' from the summary journals form refreshes the posting status for the journal.
    Exercise: Generate recurring journal (path 1)-> GLVO/Journals/Define/Recurring, to find an existing recurring batch for generation of actual journals, and click on 'Generate' to submit or schedule the generation process
    Exercise: Generate a recurring journal (path 2) -> GLVO/Journals/Generate/Recurring, to list all recurring journal sources, and set the period to generate the journal.

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Source References and Drill-Back
    If summary mode is used, detail audit trail references back to the feeder are maintained in GL_IMPORT_REFERENCES.
        This option is activated for each journal source in the Journal Sources form
        Drill back is possible directly if detail mode is used based on values placed in REFERENCE_1 through REFERENCE_10 on journal lines
    If detail mode is used, one or more of the RERFERENCE_X columns carries enough information to drill back to the source
        For Project Accounting
            REFERENCE_1 - Source Expenditure Batch Name
            REFERENCE_2 - Source Expenditure DR Code Combination
            REFERENCE_3 - Source Cost or Liability
        For Accounts Payable
            REFERENCE_1 - Vendor Name
            REFERENCE_2 - Invoice ID
            REFERENCE_3 - Invoice or Check Line
            REFERENCE_4 - Payment Document
            REFERENCE_5 - Invoice No
            REFERENCE_6 - Accounting Type
            REFERENCE_7 - Source ID
            REFERENCE_8 - Not used
            REFERENCE_9 - Document ID
            REFERENCE_10 - Line Type

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on AutoPosting
    Autoposting is performed by running the Autoposting concurrent process with a criteria set as the parameter
        Criteria sets can define multiple criteria rows with ranked priorities
        Criteria sets include: source, category, balance type and period
            For each value you have the option of entering 'ALL' to pick up all sources, categories, balance types and periods
            You can enable or disable an autoposting set through the 'Enabled' checkbox
    You can submit or schedule the Autopost process directly from the Autopost Criteria Set form
    The process produces an Autopost Execution Report
    If MRC is enabled an Autoposting set must be created in the reporting set of books to post those journals also

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Automatic Journal Reversals
    Automatic reversals are setup by Category in General Ledger
    A Profile Option must be set to trigger the 'Program - Automatic Reversal' after a period is opened
        Profile Option -> GL: Launch AutoReverse After Open Period

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Accounting Sequences and Sequence Numbers
    You can set a sequence number assignment automatically on a journal entry
    Sequences assigned to journals are based on category but not on source or any other attribute like balancing segment
        This means you may have to split companies by set of books if regulation requires that each company have their own sequence numbering rules
    Make sure the profile option 'Sequential Numbering' is set to 'Always Used' for the Site or Responsibility
        Otherwise you will get an error when entering the journal
    You first define a Sequence and then Assign it
    You have to set up an assignment as Manual on one line and Automatic on the second line if you need it to work both ways

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Reporting Sequences and Sequence Numbers
    See - R12 What are the Differences Between Accounting Sequencing and Reporting Sequencing? [ID 756774.1]
    GLXJEENT Document Number Is Not Generated On Journal Entries Header (Doc ID 1333891.1)
    Reporting Sequences are generated at period end by the close process to stamp a reporting sequence number on each journal
    The process is triggered in the Close
    Reporting sequences are used on regulatory reports for 'gapless' auditing

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Account Aliases
    Reference: Oracle Flexfields Guide, Chapter 5, 'Using Additional Flexfield Features'
    Account aliases can be defined to speed up entry of account values by naming combinations of accounts
    Aliases are flexfield functions and not specific to GL
    Navigation: <General Ledger Superuser>/Setup/Financials/Flexfields/Key/Aliases - and query back the correct key flexfield before to create a new alias
    Account aliases can be setup with null segments and these can be filled in on the fly during journal entry

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Journal Reversals
    Reversing journals are automated in 11i by setting up reversing rules
        They can be used to reverse accruals or depreciation after management reports are generated

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Account Analysis and Drilldown
    Exercise: Review an account -> General Ledger Superuser/Inquiry/Account -> and enter value in Accounts block.
        Then 'Show Balances'
    A new web front end for Account Analysis and Drilldown was introduced in 11.5.10 (Family Pack G)
        References: See Metalink Note 290012.1 May 2007
    The 'Summary Templates' feature cannot be used - see Oracle Note 414403.1
        There is an enhancement request to fix this bug
        The workaround is to drill up from the detail account to the summary after querying the detail account combinations
    The view XLA_PA_EI_AEL_GL_V provides drill back to Project Expenditure lines from GL Journal Batches with source 'Projects'

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Suspense Accounts
    Suspense accounts are defined for imported journals that are out of balance
    They can be defined by category and source

Genera Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Journal Approvals
    General Ledger uses workflow to implement a journal approval process - optional in GL
    It is not integrated with Approvals Management Enging (AME) and AME cannot be used
    The setup for Journal Approval is documented in the GL User Guide (separate chapter)
    There is a profile option "Journals:Find Approver Method" to use a custom approval hierarchy instead of employee/supervisor
    Approval is based on the value of the largest value journal line (on the basis each line has an approval limit)

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Opening Balance Loads for Balance Conversions
    See metalink note: 141069.1 How To Load Initial (Beginning) Balances Into General Ledger
    You must load opening balances as journals in the prior non-adjustment period
    Then the loaded values will appear as opening balances in the period needed

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Budgeting and Budget Upload:
    Budgeting and cost allocation supports management or cost accounting
        Other types of accounting are financial, tax, and non-profit or fund accounting
    Budget journals are entered to establish a budget.
    Budgets can also be uploaded from a spreadsheet as 'amounts' (replace existing) or journals (add to existing)
        A journal must specify the budget name since multiple budgets are possible
        A journal must also specify a budget organization
            The budget organization restricts which accounts in the budget will be maintained
            It also establishes the controls on those accounts
            Budget organizations are defined and associated with ranges of accounts
            This decentralizes budget entry through the business, such as the operating unit level.
            Budgets can be secured at the Budget Organziation level by password.
            You can have any number of budgets. Budget organizations apply across all budgets
            Account ranges in budget organizations cannot overlap between different budgets for the same set of books
            Budget range assignments (within ranges on budget organizations) allow adding or deleting individual accounts to a budget within a defined range
    Cost accounting is supported by incorporating a product and department (cost center) segment in the chart of accounts KFF structure
    Budget periods can be month, quarter, half year, or year and should coincide with the periods in the set of books for financial reporting
    Budgetary control in non-profit organizations limits expenditures to prevent exceeding budget amounts
        This is mandated by law for government and non-profit organizations
    Funds checking verifies available funds in a budget before accepting the transaction.
        Funds checking is advisory or absolute, and is implemented in the ledger and in subledger systems also
    Funds checking takes total budget and subtracts actual expenditures and encumbrances to calculate available funds
    Budgets can be entered via journals using 'budget' for the journal type
    An unlimited number of budget versions can be stored
    Budget Wizard
        References
            How to use Budget Wizard functionality in WebAdi (step-by-step) (Doc ID 471044.1)
        Profile Option 'GL: Default Desktop Viewer' must be set to Excel 2007 or another valid value
        Budgets can also be entered through the budget wizard within WebADI, or via OFA (Oracle Financial Analyzer)
            Budgeting through the webADI budget-specific wizard allows using formula
                This enables calculating new budgets based on old actuals, at the account balance level
    Massbudget is an allocation method for creating budgets
        It can take a high level budget and spread it across detailed accounts based on posted account balances
    Posting encumbrance or budget journals updates balances rolling forward to the end of the most recent open year.
    Budgets can be 'open' for entry, 'current' and active for a given period, or 'frozen' from further changes.
        A 'Frozen' budget cannot be changed
        An 'Open' budget can be updated or have no budgets loaded
        The 'Current' allows the same activities as an 'Open' budget and also defaults onto Budget-related maintenance forms
            You can only have one 'current' budget in a given period
            The option to  set a budget as current does not appear in the Status List of Values if an existing budget has the 'Current' status
    If accounts are added after a budget is defined, use the Maintain button on the budget organization form to update the budget ranges with these new accounts. A concurrent request is initiated
    Budget Upload is possible via webADI or by Uploading to GL_BUDGET_INTERFACE using SQL*Loader
        Budget Values are uploaded to GL_BUDGET_INTERFACE and replace existing budget amounts
        Budget Journals are uploaded to GL_INTERFACE and add to existing amounts
        Budgets are loaded into the GL_BUDGET_INTERFACE table and cannot be deleted if in error
            A SQL script must be used to delete budgets uploaded in error
            See: How To Delete Bad Data From The GL_BUDGET_INTERFACE Table (Doc ID 198481.1)
        Use ADI to load budgets via the responsibility: General Ledger SuperUser (or Manager)
            Navigate -> Journals -> Launch Journal Wiziard
        Configure the budget upload via the responsibility: General Ledger Desktop Integration (Web ADI)
            Navigate -> Define Mapping -> Choose Integrator = 'General Ledger - Budgets'
    Exercise: Define a budget -> GLVO/GLVO/Budgets/Define/Budget, to establish a budget and set the budget status,
        Open the budget for the next period
        Make the budget 'current' - not that only one budget can be current at any one time
        If the 'current' value does not appear, another budget is current and must be frozen to release the current status
    Exercise: Create a budget org -> GLVO/Budgets/Define/Organization, and set up an organization with account ranges, display sequence, password protection
    Exercise: Modify a budget org -> GLVO/Budgets/Define/Organization
    Exercise: Open budget periods -> GLVO/Budgets/Define/Organization/
       Change the end period (Last Date) to the end of a new year, then click 'Open Next Year'
    Exercise: Delete a budget org -> GLVO/Budgets/Define/Organization, and query the budget org, then click the Delete key to kick off the concurrent process
    Exercise: Enter a budget journal -> GLVO/Budgets/Enter/Journals, and specify the budget name and the budget organization for this journal. Enter the budget amounts and create the journal and batch (batch name required). Subsequently 'import' the journal to add it to the unposted journals file. View output from the import process to verify success. A subsequent posting step is required. This will create
    Exercise: Enter a budget amount -> GLVO/Budgets/Enter/Amounts (no audit trail), to enter a budget for a range of accounts, for each period in a budget year. Must specifify budget org and budget name.

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Encumbrances
    Encumbrances are used by non-profit organizations and are implemented in Oracle as a balance type.
    Encumbrances are reserves held against accounts to fund specific transactions such as purchase orders
    Recurring allocations can be setup to repeat every month
    Net allocations only allocate the net change in an account since the last allocation was performed
    Exercise: Enter an encumbrance -> GLVO/Journals/Encumbance

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Allocations:
    Allocations can be budget or actual using the MassBudget and MassAllocation tools
    Allocations can be applied to actual or encumbrance amounts through the MassAllocation tool also.
    Allocations can be setup and maintained through the autoallocations workbench in the GL: by defining an allocation set of several lines and defining if these lines are step down (sequential) or parallel
    Step down allocations cascade down, so the target of one allocation becomes the source for the second round of allocations
    Exercise: Generate an allocation journal -> GLVO/Journals/Generate/Allocation, and select an allocation journal to generate (only allocation journals are listed). It must subsequently be posted via normal journal entry/post

        Navigation -> <General Ledger Super User>/Consolidation/...
    Overview
        Consolidation is the period-end process of combining the financial results of separate subsidiaries with the parent company to form a single, combined statement of financial results. 
            The Global Consolidation System (GCS) provides the flexibility to help you manage your consolidation needs regardless of your company structure
        GCS is part of the General Ledger and is separate to Consolidation Hub which is a module within Enterprise Performance Foundation
            Consolidation Hub is a broader application than GCS with broader reporting and upload facilities
            GCS can be used for most consolidation tasks without the need to implement Consolidation Hub
        GCS combines the financial results of multiple subsidiaries with multiple sets of books at period-end into the parent set of books
            Companies with a common global set of books do not require GCS - they can use FSG to do their consolidations
                This is a 'reporting consolidation'
            Companies with different sets of books (different charts of accounts, currencies or calendars) should use GCS
                This is a 'data transfer consolidation'
        Includes preparing and posting consolidation data from subsidiaries to a Consolidation Chart of Accounts
        Elimination entries are prepared after posting to cancel out offsetting postings (e.g. purchases and sales)
        The accounting structures of the subsidiaries can vary widely
        Both budgets and actuals can be consolidated
        Source data for consolidation can include spreadsheets, non-Oracle applications and other Oracle General Ledgers
            An Open Consolidation Interface is available to import from non-Oracle Sources
    Mappings
        Mappings are defined from child entities to parent entities in GCS
        Mappings are built between Charts of Accounts (not ledgers) and are effective dated
        There are Segment Rules and Account Rules in mappings
        Account Rules override Segment Rules and directly map combination from the source to the parent ledger

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Enhanced Inter-Company Processing
    Enhanced intercompany processing was introduced in 11i with the concept of a Balancing Segment Qualifier
    It automatically creates balancing intercompany entries between two companies in the same Legal Entity and Set of Books
        It requires setting up of at least one clearing account
        Multiple clearing accounts can be setup based on source and category
        It also requires setting the 'Balance Intercompany Journals' flag on the set of books definition
    Additional sources of reference for enhanced intercompany transactions include:

    GIS automates journal generation of intercompany (inter-balancing segment) jourals and approvals
        Inter-company can be inter-balancing segment or higher (i.e. between Legal Entities and between Sets of Books)
        It is most beneficial between Sets of Books because other methods can be used at lower levels
        For inter-company entries within the same set of books, manual or automated intercompany accounting can be used
        Automated intercompany accounting requires an inter-company segment in the chart of accounts
            Oracle generates intercompany entries using the inter-company account values
        For charts without an intercompany segment, GIS can be used at different levels ...
            For journals between balancing segments in the same legal entity, direct entry can be used
                Security rules must allow the user to post to the different balancing segments
                Amounts can be cleared through equity (CR account) for each company
            For journals between legal entities in the same set of books, direct entry can also be used
                A responsibility with the appropriate security rules must be used
                Clearing accounts (AR Clearing, AP clearing) must be used instead of equity
            For journals across sets of books, inter-company accounting using the inter-company segment cannot be used
                This is because the intercompany segment values don't exist on the set of books on either side
            GIS provides automatic exchange rate calculations and approvals
    GIS forces approvals of intercompany charges generated by the Oracle GL when different sets of books are used in a Journal
    Spreadsheet upload can be used to load large volumes of transactions
    Approval notifications are generated by workflows
        Users on both sides of the transaction must have access to Oracle Workflow to use it
        An email notification opens a workflow approval screen within Oracle for approvals
        However their GL's don't have to be Oracle on the other side of the transaction
        Oracle will create JE's in the GL_INTERFACE table which may be exported to the foreign GL
            Transactions are initially imported to the GL_IEA_INTERFACE table
            A process is run to validate the records and load them to GL_INTERFACE
            You can delete errored journal lines from GL_INTERFACE and resubmit
                Navigation -> <General Ledger Super User>/Journals/Import/Delete
    Receiver-side transactions can be generated automatically from GIS Sender entries
        The sender inputs the sender and receiver names and the type of transactions
            User-defined accounting rules for the sender/receiver/type derive receiver accounts based on sender entries.
            The intercompany clearing accounts are also tied to these types
            Note that clearing accounts are tied to the transaction type - the charge accounts are entered directly
            Each intercompany journal is specific to a sender/receiver/type
                This means larger 'distribution' journals from one sender to multiple receivers cannot be entered
        The receiver account distributions can be entered manually or derived automatically
            Automatic derivation is done through auto-accounting rules
    Currency conversion is automated - and performed after the transaction is approved on all sides
    GIS operates in two basic scenarios - common sets of books and dissimilar sets of books
        If the sets of books are different, a GIS Intercompany SOB must be defined for the dissimilar subsidiaries
        The Intercompany SOB is then mapped to the local set of books
    AGIS (Advanced Global Intercompany System)
        Responsibilities -> In Vision use Global Intercompany System - Vision Enterprises
        References - http://davidhaimes.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/intercompany-invoicing-in-agis/
        AGIS creates documents for inter-company accounting such as payable invoice and receivable invoices
            The intercompany documents include taxes
            The invoices are created in the AP and AR Invoice Import Interfaces for the respective counterparties
        Creation of documents is optional - journal entries can be created instead

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Statistical Amounts
    Statistical amounts are entered either with STAT currency or with units of measure (mixed)
        Either way they create STAT balances on GL_BALANCES when the journal is posted
        STAT Currency journals do not have a UOM - they have only a debit or credit amount as STAT currency
        You do not have to assign a UOM to an account to post a mixed journal and see the STAT balances in GL_BALANCES
    The profile option 'Journals: Mix Statistical and Monetary' must be enabled for mixed journal entry
    For mixed journals, each account has a default UOM assigned but this is optional
        Navigation: GL Superuser/Setup/Accounts/Units (saved in table GL_STAT_ACCOUNT_UOM)
        UOM's can be different for different accounts within the same chart of accounts
    Statistical amounts can be used to calculate allocation journals

General Ledger (GL Schema) Interfaces - including Journal Entries from Subledgers:
    FA: Asset Additions, Depreciation, Retirements
    PO: Encumbrances
    AP: Expense Invoices, Asset Invoices, Inventory Invoices, Supplier Payments
    AR: Sales Invoices, Cash Receipts, Adjustments, Cash Applications
    OM: Unbilled Receivables
    ADI: Journals, Budgets
    INV: Inventory Values, Cost of Sales
    GL: Consolidations Journals from on SOB to another SOB
    PAY: Payroll Expenses
    Journal Import Process- to import journals from Oracle subledger systems or from third party systems
        by populating GL_INTERFACE table and running the import process).
        Suspense can be corrected in the Correct Journal Import Data form
        Unwanted entries can be deleted using the Delete form (Navigatio -> <General Ledger Super User>/Journals/Import/Delete
    'Program - Import Journals' can be scheduled to import journals in SRS (added in 11.5.10)
        The program calls 'Journal Import'
        It is limited because it requires a Group ID (leaving blank will only import journals with no group id)
            Most subledgers put group id's on their journals so it cannot be used for this purpose

General Ledger (GL) Localizations:
    The chart of accounts in France is mandated to be a fixed structure
        the account numbers are mandated.
        A separate SOB can be established and GCS used to populate after month-end

General Ledger (GL Schema) Forms and Navigation:
    Journals -> GENERAL LEDGER/Journals/Enter - and query existing journals to display journal details
    Period Types -> GENERAL LEDGER/Setup/Calendar/Types - to establish period types before creating a calendar
    Calendars (Periods) -> GENERAL LEDGER/Setup/Calendar/Accounting - to create a calendar and each period within the calendar
    Set of Books -> GENERAL LEDGER/Setup/Financials/Books/Define - to associate a currency, calendar and chart of accounts and define a set of books
    Assign Reporting Sets of Books -> GENERAL LEDGER/Setup/Financials/Books/Assign - to associate multiple reporting sets of books to a primary set of books
    Import Journals -> General Ledger/Journals/Import/Run - to import transactions from the GL_INTERFACE table populated earlier by 'Transfer to GL' programs in feeder systems
    Correct Journal Import Data -> GENERAL LEDGER/Journals/Import/Correct - requires a Source to bring back errors to correct
    Journal Sources -> GENERAL LEDGER/Setup/Journals/Sources - to define sources and activate source references for drillback on summary imported journals
    Currency Conversion Rate Types -> GENERAL LEDGER/Setup/Currencies/Rates/Types - to view seeded types (Corporate/Spot/User) and define additional types
    Daily (Currency) Rates -> GENERAL LEDGER/Setup/Currencies/Rates/Daily - to enter daily currency exchange rates for any conversion type
    Summary Accounts -> GENERAL LEDGER/Setup/Accounts/Summary - to establish summary accounts based on rollup groups for online display

    Account Hierarchy Editor -> via ADI
    Mass Maintenance Workbench -> ... to merge balances from multiple accounts to another, and otherwise maintain the chart of accounts structure

General Ledger (GL Schema) Concurrent Processes:
    Open Period - to open a new accounting period (also kicked off from Open/Close form in setup)
        This process creates new lines in GL_BALANCES to carry forward all the balances from the previous period
    Autopost - post journals on a repeating schedule based on criteria values: sources, categories, balance types and periods
    Program - Import Journals - can be scheduled in SRS to run journal import but it requires a group id - no group id will only import journals with a blank group id
    Inherit Segment Value Attributes - to synchronize changes in account segment attributes with GL Code Combinations

General Ledger (GL Schema) Notes on Standard Reports and XML Publisher (BI Publisher) Reports:
    Trial Balance - list of account combinations for a single balancing segment (ie company), showing opening balance, activity and closing balance. A trial balance shows total debits for all accounts and for all accounts to prove that debits and credits across all accounts 'balance'. Trial balances are not company specific because they add up DR/CR's for all accounts
    Account Analysis - 132 char or 180 char showing account opening balance, period activity and closing balance
    Journals Execution Report - list of all failed transactions in the GL_INTERFACE table with reason codes why the transactions failed GL Journal import
    Three XML Publisher Reports were introduced in Family Pack G in May 2007 (Metalink Note 290012.1)
        Account Analysis
        Journals - General
        Trial Balance - Detail

General Ledger (GL Schema) Workflows:
    Account Generator - automatically builds valid account code combinations (a successor to Flexbuilder introduced in Rel 10)

    FND_CURRENCIES - defines each possible currency
    GL_BALANCES - balances for every code combination, currency and period
        There is one line in this table for each currency and previously opened period and there is always a line for the functional currency
        If the period has not been opened there are no lines
        The BEQ fields on each foreign currency line represent the 'Base Equivalent' values in the functional currency
        The functional currency line includes the total values for actual functional currency entries and all foreign currency BEQ values in the same period.

    XLA_PA_EI_AEL_GL_V - drill back to Projects Expenditure Items from GL Batches

Global Accounting Engine (AX) Notes:
    The Global Accounting Engine is used in countries with different accounting rules to GAAP in the US
    It replaces the journal transfers from subledgers to GL with an intermediate subledger system
    The Global Accounting Engine holds all journals from subledgers as draft entries
        The draft entries must be finalized before they can be posted to the GL
    Adjustments can be entered to the Global Accounting Engine directly, prior to finalization and GL posting

Hyperion Enterprise Notes on General Functionality:
    Oracle purchased Hyperion on 01 March 2007 for $3.3 Billion USD
        It is classified as EPM or Enterprise Performance Management Software
    Hyperion Enterprise is a financial collection, consolidation and reporting tool
        It supports adjustments and formatting processes in addition to collection
        Processes include:
            Foreign currency conversion
            Allocations
            Adjustments
            Intercompany Eliminations for consolidation (with full audit trail)
            Legal Ownership Rollup Reporting
        It supports US GAAP, International Accounting Standards (IAS) and local/regional standards
        It eliminates the collection and rekeying of data or spreadsheet manipulations
    A primary benefit of Hyperion Enterprise is shortening the financial close
    Hyperion Enterprise maintains date-effective rollup hierarchies to support backdated adjustments
    Access to Hyperion can be centralized via the web, or distributed to multiple clients and countries
    Hyperion integrates with Excel on the desktop
    Hyperion Enterprise has a Financial Data Quality Management add-on for additional data loading controls

Human Resources (HR and PER Schemas) Notes on Tips and Tricks

Human Resources (HR and PER Schemas) Notes on Profile Options
    Profile option: HR User Type' must be set on the responsibility to 'HR' to access the the Employee Maintenance form
        This is often needed to enter an employee to create a buyer or approver
        The HR application must also be a shared install for this to work.

Human Resources (HR and PER) Responsibilities:
    Global HRMS Superuser HRSU

Human Resources (HR or PER) Notes on General Functionality:
    Jobs standardize qualifications and requirements and pay grades for similar functions across different parts of the organization
    Positions are instances of jobs within an organization hierarchy and are used to calculate headcount and salary budgets
    A role is a supertype of a position or a person and roles are used in workflows for approvals
        They can point back to either a person or a position (ie employee/supervisor hierarchy or position hierarchy)
    Contingent workers are non-employees who can be setup as people and tied to user id's but do not have to be entered on a payroll
    HR generates budgets that can be posted to the GL as budget journals for employee costs
    HR supports statutory reports: COBRA, OSHA, ADA, EEO, AAP and Vets-100 in the US
    Exercise: Create organizations -> GHRSU/Work Structures/Organizations/Description - to create an organization

Human Resources Notes on Creating New Employees:
    You must choose an action type on the new employee form before saving a new employee. Use action type = 'Create Employee'
    Create an assignment and attach the new employee to the correct organization/operating unit so they are visible in drop down lists
    Exercise: Add a new employee -> Human Resources Superuser/People/Enter and Maintain, and click 'New' on the Find window

Human Resources (HR or PER) Notes on Security, Security Groups, Security Profiles and Business Groups
    Tips and Trick
        Security List Maintenance must be run after defining and assigning security profiles
        In general, a user can only view the records for one business group at a time. 
        However, depending on the value of the HR:Cross Business Group Profile option, you can view specific information across business groups
    References
        How To Restrict Supplier Records By Operating Unit with HR Security Profile (Doc ID 1271666.1)
        Understanding and Using HRMS Security in Oracle HRMS [ID 394083.1]
    HR: Security Profile controls access in HR (i.e. business groups) whereas MO: Security Profile controls access in financial subledgers and operating units
        Since an org can be a business group and operating unit, HR Security Profile takes precedence over MO: Security Profile
    HR Security Profiles can be defined for each business group to limit what users can access within the HR/Payroll applications
    Security Groups determine the Business Groups a user can access
    Security Profiles determine the organizations a user can access within a Security Group
    A Security Profile represents a distinct client or business entity (or organization unit) within a single installation of HR
    A Security Profile can be attached to a responsibility to limit user access to HR data using the standard security model
    HR has a security model that can be the Standard Security Model or the Multiple Security Groups model
    Under the Multiple Security Groups model, one responsibility can be used for all security profiles - the system prompts for the security group separately
    Under the Standard Security Model, a separate responsibility was needed for each security profile established (ie HR Security Profile)
    Security profiles also enable the cross-business group security model in HRMS where one responsibility has access to data in multiple business groups
    Security profiles include qualifiers such as employee type (employee, contingent, recruit), organization top level of access, included or excluded sub organizations and associated business group
    Security profiles are specific to HR and not used in the other applications - they partition an HR implementation to limit access to individual clients
    Security profiles are assigned to responsibilities in HR. If only one seeded Security Group is defined, users will not be asked which security group to use, when they choose a responsibility
    In the Applications Utilities Lookups form, a 'Global Security Group' checkbox has been introduced with the Multiple Security Group model to make lists of values local to their business group
    If the profile option "HR:Business Group" is set to a different group that the one included in the "HR:Security Profile" profile option, HR Security will prevent access to data
    Profile Option -> HR:Security Profile - lists the Security Profiles created through the 'Define Security Profile' form and limits access to HR data (including organization definitions)
    Profile Option -> HR:Security Group is used to set the security group for a user and is attached to a responsibility
    Profile Option -> Enable Security Groups - is set to 'No' by default and should be set to 'Yes' before running the concurrent process 'Enable Multiple Security Groups'
    Do -> Create Security Profile: Global HRMS Super User/ and search for 'Define Security Profile'

iAssets (FA) Notes on General Functionality
    iAssets is a self service application allowing users to transfer assets across cost centers
    iAssets uses Workflow for transfer approvals

iAssets (FA) Notes on Setup and Troubleshooting
    Setup rules must be established and assigned to responsibilities or an error is thrown at logon
        See Metalink Note: 287309.1 iAssets FAQ's
        A security rule must be established and tied to an iAssets responsibility via Profile Option
        The Profile Option is "IA: iAssets Rule Name"
        The security rule is defined through the "iAssets Setup Administrator" Responsibility

iAssets (FA Schema) Notes on Asset Inquiry

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Getting Started
    Use an Internet Procurement responsibility to bring up the self-service webpage (like 'Internet Procurement')
        The responsibility must be a 'Self Service Web Applications' application to display the self service web page
    Verify the securing attributes ICX_HR_PERSON_ID and TO_PERSON_ID are set on the user record
        Both values must be set to the 'Person' employee number from the HR system
        Without this setup, the message "<responsibility> is not a valid responsibility for the current user"
            Try reassigning the person values to the securing attributes and logging out/logging in again.
        The Internet procurement application require a person on a user record before entering the application
            This is done because iProc needs to access an approval hierarchy in HR for approvals)

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Best Practices:
    Internet procurement is a best practice
        by putting requisitioning and receiving into the hands of the requestors,
        generalizing requisitions in an organization and
        eliminating centralized requisitioning
    Centralized purchasing combined with decentralized requisitioning and receiving

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Tips and Tricks:
    Before creating requisitions, create personal profile defaults for charge accounts or add a default charge account to the assignment purchasing region in Human Resources
    Use Power Checkout to delete multiple selected rows from a cart, to update accounting on selected rows and to add supplier/site sourcing details on unsourced catalog items
    You can find the purchase order number of an approved requisition on the details page of the requisition status in iprocurement
    Requistions that are incomplete can be viewed in the shopping cart but cannot be viewed in the core applications
    The basic iProcurement process is: shop catalog, checkout (delivery info, billing info, notes, approvers, review and submit)
    An iProcurement installation without Core Apps includes shared HR and Purchasing tables
    The default charge account which is changeable during checkout is set as the default charge account for purchase orders for the requestor
    A single item can be split across multiple accounts on a percentage basis by clicking the charge account link in checkout and choosing the option to enter multiple accounts
    Project accounting can be manually recorded on requisition lines including project number, task and expenditure type
    Requisitions can be copied to create new requisitions
    As of 2001 it was not possible to requisition items for internal sourcing from inventory in iProcurement.
    Make or buy is an attribute on the item master that decides if an item is to be received into expense or inventory
    The profile option 'POR: Enable Requisition Line Customization' controls customizations on requisitions and can be turned off for troubleshooting

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Troubleshooting:
    The main "Requisitions" form in Oracle Forms won't find an iProc Requisition (or any requisition)
        Use the "Requisitions Summary" form to find iProc requisitions in Oracle Purchasing

Internet Procurement (iProc, ICX and POR) Personalization and Customization
    You can customize the menus under iProcurement responsibility to exclude sub-menus and functions from appearing on the web forms

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on 'My Profile' Settings (Requisition Preferences)
    My Profile allows setups/defaults for delivery, billing (including projects), favorite charge accounts, display preferences and password changes
    Delivery defaults include: need by date, requestor, deliver to (address and subinventory)
    Billing defaults include project details: project number, task, award, expenditure type, expenditure org and expenditure item date
    Favorite charge accounts allow users to setup short-name combinations of charge accounts and select them during checkout
    Display preferences in iProcurement are the same as display preferences in Self Service through the portal 'Preferences' menu item.
        Changing preferences in one place changes them for both
    If the error displays when looking at this page
        "You have encountered an unexpected error. Please contact the System Administrator for assistance"
        a likely cause is "when the location for the requester is not setup and the profile "POR: Preferences-Deliver to location"
        See metalink note: 444479.1
        a second cause is the profile option "POR Preferences - Expenditure Org" which should be set to a valid org_id (not an org name)
    Preferences Profile Options include:
        POR: Preferences - Award
        POR: Preferences - Deliver-to Location
        POR: Preferences - Project
        POR: Preferences - Expenditure Type
        POR: Preferences - Project
        POR: Preferences - Expenditure Org
        POR: Preferences - Requester
        POR: Preferences - Selected Items Default to Inventory

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on the Web Applications Dictionary (WAD):
    The Web Applications Dictionary is repository of metadata that is used to build webpages
        It is customizable and can be edited to change the appearance of web pages
        It can be used to customize iProcurement web pages
    The WAD allows hiding and showing of base descriptors in the catalog
    Oracle uses PL/SQL to generate web pages from the Web Applications Dictionary
    The responsibility "Self Service Web Applications Manager" is used to customize these webpages
    Display Manager is a middle tier java program that reads the repository and renders the pages
        It uses the region definition and and XML User Interface Template
    Custom webpages can be built in addition to modifying existing pages
        Create or change attributes via the "Self Service Web Applications Manager" responsibility
        Choose "Attributes/Define Attributes"
        Also define new objects via the "Object Workbench"
        Attach attributes to the object
        Create unique keys to sort the display
        Set the primary key on the object definition
        assign new attributes to PO_DUMMY_O object
        associate foreign keys to PO_DUMMY_O
    Choose the Regions Menu to define a single row or multi-row region
        also tag which items belong to a specific region
    Terminology
        Object -> a database view upon which a web form is built
        Attributes -> reusable fields on a web page
        Object Attribute -> an attribute that is tied to an object or database value
        Region -> an area on a webpage
        Region Item -> an attribute that is associated with a specific region
        Flow -> a series of web pages

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on the Catalog and eContent Manager (ECM):
    The internet procurement internal unified catalog is in the ICX schema. This catalog is separate from the Oracle Purchasing catalog
    The catalog structure for the unified iprocurement catalog is typically flat, with base and local descriptors to aid searching
    Base descriptors are common attributes such as names, uoms, prices, apply to all items in the catalog. They can be hidden or visible. Seeded base descriptors cannot be changed
    Local descriptors apply to all items in a specific category. Examples are shape, color, and size. Local descriptors can be hidden and are always optional
    Descriptors in the Oracle Purchasing Catalog are called 'Descriptive Elements' and are defined at the category level
    Purchasing categories must be loaded into iProcurement before items are loaded - by using Loader Values in Oracle Purchasing
    The two methods of loading are 'extract and load' from Purchasing, or Bulk Load from external catalogs
    ECM (eContent Manager) supports schema editing: adding, deleting and renaming categories, base descriptors and local descriptors.
    ECM allows for mapping purchasing categories to iProcurement categories - through the ECM Category Mapper utility
    Each iProcurement category must map to only one purchasing category so that requisitioned items inherit the purchasing category attributes
    Several iProcurement categories can map to the same purchasing category
    ECM provides a reverse mapper to map iProc classifications back to Purchasing Categories - Special Order Mapping Utility in ECM
    The ECM Classifier assigns items to categories and definition of categories on the fly. XML category files can also be uploaded
    Only purchasing categories in the purchasing category set are mappable - the purchasing category set is the default set for purchasing items
    ECM allows definition of a table of contents: master, intermediate (contains genus categories) and genus (contains base items) categories
    Titles are groupings of categories at the highest level and comprise the table of contents on the iProcurement home page (ie catalog level)
    Items that can be loaded are: items from the item master, requisition templates, blanket PO's, catalog quotes, approved supplier lists
    One item in a catalog can be assigned to multiple categories - updating the item information and the change will be reflected in all assigned categories
    Requisition templates are extracted from Purchasing to iProcurement using the same method as purchasing categories
    Catalog quotations created in the purchasing catalog and downloaded to the iProc catalog contain supplier price quotes and supplier part references
    Bulk Loaded catalog items do not exist in the purchasing catalog (no part number) and are loaded directly into the iProcurement catalog
    The catalog search engine is based on Oracle ConText server and Intermedia - it was previously based on 'BugsEye' technology
    Catalogs can be loaded from XML using the Java Loader or using spreadsheet .csv files via eContent Manager
    TPN Register is a major third party catalog for supplies with Oracle integration
    Requisite and TPN Register are content providers that provide compatible catalogs to load into the iProcurement unified catalog
    Exercise: Setup loader values and do adhoc loads from Purchasing -> SSIPSU/Setup/E-Catalog Admin/Loader Values .....to transfer classification data and item data from purchasing
    Exercise: Edit Attribute 10 of the Inventory DFF  'Item Categories' -> SSIPSU/Setup/Flexfields/Descriptive and query the DFF for the Inventory Application
    Exercise: Rebuild the ConText index after changing the catalog -> IPCA/Requests/New/Rebuild Catalog Item Context, to rebuild the indices for searching using the intermedia index
    Bug: Two or more catalog load responsibilities assigned to the same user may prevent access to eContent Manager functions

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Building a Catalog Schema and Table of Contents
    You cannot edit an empty category to add subcategories - you must have at least one subcategory to add additional categories later
    To add subcategories to an empty category, delete the category in the schema editor and re-add it with a sub category in the hierarchy manager

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Bulk Loading Categories and Items to the iProc Catalog
    Bulk loading categories and catalog items and price lists is done from the eContent Manager, Bulk Load section
    There are several tools available in Content Manager: Download Resources, Bulk Load Catalog Structure, Bulk Load Items and Price Lists, and View Bulk Load Status
    'Download Resources' downloads a template spreadsheet and a set of instructions for performing all types of bulk load
    Bulk Load Catalog Structure uploads a completed spreadsheet of catalog categories to insert into the iProcurement Catalog
    Any new categories in the Items and Prices upload spreadsheet will not load unless the profile option POR: Load Auto Category is set to 'YES'. The default is 'NO'
    For debugging, the profile option POR: set debug loader should be 'ON' to create exception lines in POR_BATCH_JOBS and ICX_POR_FAILED_LINES_MESSAGES
    Exercise: Review the POR: Load Auto Category profile option -> Sysadmin/Profile/System and query the profile option 'POR: Load Auto Category'
    Exercise: Run the bulk loader -> IPCA/eContent Manager/Bulk Load Item and Price Lists/ .... and specify the file to upload

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Catalog Loading Methods:
    There are four ways to load the catalog: java loader, manual loading, extract from Purchasing, and .csv spreadsheet upload via eContent Manager
    The Java loader loads an XML file and allows category/item/descriptor adds, changes and deletes. It is the method used by Oracle Exchange
    Categories and local descriptors can be dynamically added with Java Loader for new items if the categories don't already exist
    The Java loader is run from the command line with the xml file and several run options as command line options
    A .csv file can be loaded from within the applications by choosing Catalog Authoring page and the Data Load button
    A .csv file that is targeted in an upload can be saved back as an xml file for uploading through the Java loader
    The order of columns containing descriptors in the .csv file must match the order that descriptors are chosen for loading in ECM
    Exercise: Load a .csv file to the catalog -> IPCA/Catalog Authoring/Bulk Load Items and Price Lists, and point to the .csv file to upload.

    For the first extract from purchasing, you must use the Define Catalog Server Loader values window - following times can be done by running the concurrent processes directlty
    You must run the concurrent process: Catalog Data Extract - Classifications to extract categories from Purchasing into iProcurement
    The run date is used to determine what incremental changes to migrate - set the date to an earlier date to pick up all items in the transfer
    Since descriptive elements are attached to the catalog groups in core purchasing, they do not migrate to local descriptors in iProcurement
        since only item categories and not catalog categories are loaded across
    You must run the concurrent process: Catalog Data Extract - Items to extract from the purchasing catalog
    Attribute 10 of the Inventory DFF 'Item Category' must be set to 'Y' for all categories to load from Purchasing to iProcurement through the extract
    The Catalog Data Extract can be scheduled to run at regular intervals (daily, weekly and so on)
    The concurrent process 'Catalog Data Purge' must be run to delete inactive catalog quotes, blanket agreements, items and requistion templates from the catalog
    Catalog purge only deletes expired quote/template/blanket items in the iProcurement catalog that were loaded through the purchasing interface
    A system directory must be defined for the file extracted from Purchasing to load to iProcurement - set as a utl_file_dir = /home/Oracle/outbound
    The profile options ECE: Output and ECE: Inbound must point to the utl_file_dir
    Rejected lines in the export are stored in ICX_POR_FAILED_LINES,and ICX_POR_FAILED_LINE_MESSAGES
    ICX_POR_PRICE_LISTS and ICX_POR_PRICE_LIST_LINES are populated by the loader process also
    Add-hoc loads can be done through the 'Define Catalog Server Loader Values' window in the core applications (SSIPSU responsibility)
    After loading the catalog, you must rebuild the search indices in Oracle ConText. Run the concurrent program: Rebuild Catalog Item Context
    Exercise: Run the catalog load -> PSU/E-Catalog Admin/Loader Values, brings up the 'Define Catalog Server Loader Values' window to load categories and items, ASL's, templates
    Exercise: Run the category load concurrent process -> PSU/Requests/New Requests/Catalog Data Extract - Classifications

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Requisite Technologies:
    Requisite Technology is a catalog content aggregator. They supply content from others: Grainger (parts), Corporate Express (office supplies), and Ikon (office equipment) are examples
    The Requisite catalog structure is proprietary but based on the UNSPSC structure

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Catalog Units of Measure:
    Units of measure in iProc are defined in ECM and are not the same as the UOM's defined in purchasing and inventory core applications
    UOM's in iProcurement are not inventory org specific
    The UOM names defined in ECM and loaded into iProc must exactly match the names of the UOM's in the core applications

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Punchout:
    A punchout to an external catalog is identified as a separate item source
    Punchout is setup through eContent Manager
    A site level profile option must be set to point to the punchout digital certificate for https authentication

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Images in the Catalog
    Images can be loaded into the OA_MEDIA directory (eg /u987/appsofd2/ofd2comn/java/oracle/apps/media) which is under the java top
    The reference to the file can be loaded into a catalog quote in Core Applications, and extract/loaded across
    The file name is entered into the descriptive flexfield of the catalog quote line
        use a file name relative to the OA_MEDIA directory (eg file.ext only if loaded into the OA_MEDIA top)
    The profile option POR: Hosted Images Directory must be set to /media/ which is the default subdirectory where images are placed.
    Profile options POR: Thumbnail Height and POR
        Thumbnail Width allow setting the size of thumbnails on search results but do not control the size of the full images displayed on the detail pages

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Public and Personal Shopping Lists:
    Shopping lists speed up common orders by listing commonly purchased items. Lists can be made public and shared with other users
    Public lists and personal favorites shopping lists are not updated when catalog items are updated
    Public lists can be copied to the shopping cart at the heading level of from within the list lines view
    If you copy a public list from the header level to the shopping cart, it copies the default quantities and accounts. From the line level it does not copy these values.

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Information Templates
    Information templates are supported in the iProc catalog and define additional information that accompanies an item on a requisition.
    Information templates contain attributes that have LOV's and default values - they can be attached to a single item or to a purchasing category to apply to multiple items
    It is not necessary to reimport items to the iProc catalog after defining an information template and attaching it to the item or category
    Although information templates are setup in core purchasing (iProc responsibility) they are only used in iProcurement
    A requisitioner will be prompted to enter template information during the checkout process if an information template is associated with the item or category chosen
    The LOV column on info template definitions is not used by iProcurement - LOV lists are not attachable to information templates in 11.5.8 - not yet implemented
    Attribute names defined in information templates become the field prompts in iProcurement when the template is displayed
    Exercise: Create information templates -> SSISPU/Setup/Information Templates

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Realms
    Realms are sets of access privileges to internal catalogs, internal catalog categories, and external catalogs
    Realms can be defined based on an internal catalog category or an item source.
    Sources are broad restrictions and include: internal catalog, external (punchout) catalog.
    Realms are implemented as securing attributes for responsibilities and user profiles
    Realms are inclusive rules and not exclusionary - you cannot exclude selected items from an included realm. This is an issue with realm implementation
    You cannot enforce restrictions within a realm - all items within a realm are available to the person who is assigned the realm.
        Separate categories are required to work around this restriction
    You cannot use realms to enforce content restrictions on punchouts to external catalogs
    Exercise: Define a realm -> SSIPSU/Setup/E-Catalog Admin/Realms and select item source or item category as the definging attribute
    Exercise: Attach a realm to a responsibility and user -> Sysadmin/Security/Responsibilities/Securing Attributes, and add ICX_POR_REALM_ID as an attribute

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Taxes:
    A Tax code is defaulted to the billing checkout screen of a requisition if the purchasing tax hierarchy is activated in Purchasing
    Tax codes default onto requisitions, purchase orders and blanket releases if the purchasing tax hierarchy is established
    The purchasing tax hierarchy allows ordered defaulting of tax codes from: ship-to location, item, supplier, supplier site, financial options

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Shopping, Checkout and Requisitions:
    A requisition number is assigned to a the contents of a shopping cart when it is first saved
    A requisition created in iProcurement can be viewed in the Oracle Purchasing application
        Use the "Requisition Summary" form to find these requisitions - not the "Requisitions" form
            Searching for a requisition through the "Requisitions" form doesn't return anything
    There are three methods of checkout: normal checkout, express checkout and power checkout
    Express checkout and power checkout require default options to be set at the user profile level
    Express checkout defaults the deliver-to, sub-inventory, name and days to receive from the user profile
        The deliver-to defaults from the users assignment location on their HR employee record
        A one-time address can be entered for the deliver-to address if needed
            This can be done during checkout on a catalog or non-catalog request
            Oracle does not create a new location for this one time address
            It is passed to the purchase order as a one-time deliver-to address
        The location record has a Ship-To location which becomes the ship-to on the purchase order
    Power checkout includes the Express Checkout defaults and also adds approvals, allows line splitting of distributions
    Attachments can be added to requisitions in the final stages of checkout
    There are several attachment types: internal, miscellaneous, to approver, to buyer, to receiver and to supplier
        Attachments which are internal or miscellaneous go on the requisition only and do not appear to others
        Attachments to the approver appear in the approver's window for the requisition
        Attachments to the buyer appear in the autogenerate window for the buyer creating the purchase orders
        Attachments to the supplier are printed on the purchase order and appear in the iSupplier portal
    The inventory organization on a requisition line defaults from the inventory organization assigned to the location
    If there is no inventory organization assigned to the location, the inventory organization is defaulted from the financial options for the operating unit assiged to the responsibility
                The inventory organization for a requisition line cannot be changed in iProcurement - however it can be changed in the core applications

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Contractor Requests
    Contractor request lines cannot be combined with non-contractor request lines in the same shopping cart or requisition
        Oracle will start a new shopping cart or contractor requisition if mixed shopping is performed.

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Automatically Generating PO's from iProcurement Requisitions
    See this topic under Purchasing for information on how to automatically create purchase orders from requisitions
        Profile option settings are required together with a blanket purchase order

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Cancelling Requisitions:
    You can cancel a requisition if it has not created an open purchase order, otherwise the purchase order must be cancelled first
    If you select a requisition to cancel in iProcurement and it has an active purchase order, the check box to choose each line to cancel does not appear.

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Accounting Distributions:
    Account Generator generates charge account distributions from the project (custom), item (for inventory destinations), from the user assignment (for expense destinations, including projects) and user profile favorites list
    Account Generator rules are based on destination type:
        inventory or expense or shop floor.
        Expense destinations can be inventory (expense items) or non-inventory
    All bulk loaded items are expense destination types by default.
        If an inventory destination is required, the items must be defined in core purchasing and extracted and loaded.
    If an item is bulk loaded rather than defined in core purchasing and inventory ...
        there is insufficient information on the item to allow a destination type of inventory.
    For items extracted and loaded from core purchasing ...
        the destination type is defaulted from the item attribute 'Inventory Asset Value' in the costing region of the master item window
    If the 'Inventory Asset Value' checkbox is blank, the item is a non-inventoried expense item and is assigned a destination type of 'expense'.
        If it is checked, the destination type is Inventory
    For destination type of 'Inventory' ...
        the 'Asset Subinventory' checkbox on the subinventory record is checked
            to see if it is an expense subinventory (destination type = expense) or asset subinventory
    The order of precedence for obtaining a charge account for an expense destination type item is:
        Item default charge account,
        item category charge account,
        employee default charge account
    A user can define and name and save overriding charge account distributions
        This is done in 'My Profile' in iProcurement
        The user can choose one of these distributions through power checkout
    However if the item is a bulk loaded item and not defined in core purchasing, the order of precedence is: Item Category charge account, employee assignment default charge account
    The default charge account for an employee is set in the employee assignment record, in the 'Purchase Order Information' alternate region.
    A requisitioner can split the charge account distributions on a requisition in checkout by clicking on 'Multiple Account Distributions' in the accounting checkout window
    Exercise: Setup default charge account for expenses for item -> Purchasing Superuser/Items/Master Items/Purchasing Region
    Exercise: Setup accounts for categories -> ProcuretoPay/Purchasing Setup/Financials/Accounts/Expense Account Rules, and enter the expense account for each category
    Exercise: Setup default charge accounts for employees (HR installed) -> HRVE/People/Enter and Maintain/ and find an employee, then navigate to Assignments/Purchase Order Info (alternate region)
    Exercise: Setup favorite charge accounts for employees in iProcurement -> IPSU/iProcurement/Home Page/My Profile, and edit/add favorite account code combinations

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Receiving
Items are eligible for receiving in iProcurement if the PO shipment line is "Open for Receiving" and the receipt routing is "Direct"
    Items eligible for receiving can be restricted to a single inventory organization by setting the profile option POR_ORGANIZATION_ID at the user level
        This limits viewing receipts to a single inventory organization
    The direct routing allows the user to create a receiving and delivery transaction in a single entry
    Inspection and receiving can be recorded by an employee in iProcurement directly, rather than in purchasing/receiving.
    The default receipt routing must be set to 'Direct' in iProcurement for receiving - this is set in receiving options
    The default receipt routing can be overridden at the item level receiving options, for master items and for organizational items
    The actual receipt routing on a purchase order can be viewed through the Receiving Controls tab on the PO shipment line
    Return items can be recorded if a supplier sends and RMA transaction via iSupplier Portal
    Users can receive a workflow notification of overdue receipts and respond: fully received, not received, partially or over-received, or reassign
    Temporary reassignments can be set on the 'Notification Reassignments' form for 'Requisition Approvals' and for 'Confirm Receipts' - from the notification
    Profile Option: POR: Enable Blind Receiving - when set to 'No' defaults the quantity available and displays the quantity received and quantity ordered columns
    Profile Option: POR: Support Review for Express Receive - when set to 'No' takes the receiver past the 'Receive Items:
        Review and Submit' page directly to the 'Receive Items: Confirmation' page
    Exercise: Receive Items - SSIPSU/Requisition Status/Receiving
    Exercise: Return Items - SSIPSU/Requistions Status/Receiving/Return Items

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on P-Cards:
    P-Cards in iProcurement apply to all lines on a requisition and cannot be different on each line
    A default P-Card number is setup in the user default profile for iProcurement
    Oracle Payables must be setup to allow P-Cards (several steps) and the supplier site P-Card Allowed check box must be set

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Projects Integration:
    Use My Profile to set the default project, task and expenditure type to default onto the checkout details of a requisition

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Notes on Inventory Integration

    Create information templates for items -> IPSU/Setup/Information Templates

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Profile Options:
    The profile option 'PO:Allow Requisition Approval Forward Action' enables requistion and po approval workflows to forward to the next approver if the current approver times out
    The profile option 'POR_ORGANIZATION_ID' limits what can be received in iProcurement to a single inventory organization
    The profile option 'POR: Enable Requisition Line Customization' controls customizations on requisitions and can be turned off for troubleshooting

Internet Procurement (iProc ICX and POR) Workflows:
    Workflows for internet procurement are setup in core purchasing.
        The profile option 'PO: Allow Requisition Approval Forward Action' enables forwarding if an approver times out
    PO Requistions Approval  - submits requistions to approvers
    PO Approval - submits purchase orders to approvers
    PO Document Creation - initiated if automatic sourcing rules are defined using:
        ASL's, blanket PO's, catalog quotes, and from the Create Release concurrent process
        This workflow is used to manage the autocreation of purchasing documents.
        PO Document Creation Workflow is initiated when you define automatic sourcing rules
            using an ASL, blanket purchase orders or catalog quotes and the Create Release concurrent process.
            Oracle Self-Service Purchasing 5 references contract purchase agreement with a supplier site as a part of sourcing.
            An automatic workflow process creates a standard purchase order referencing the contract purchase agreement.
            This workflow has been enhanced for automating the creation of standard purchase orders even if quotations with specific item information do not exist.
            Based on the supplier and supplier site on the requisition line, the workflow looks for a valid contract purchase agreement in Oracle Purchasing.
            If a valid contract purchase agreement is found, the requisition line is automatically placed on a standard purchase order
                with a reference to the contract purchase agreement on the purchase order line.
            This functionality can be enabled by setting the workflow attribute CONTRACT_ID.
            If this attribute is set to  Y , Contract Purchasing Agreements can be used to create standard POs.

    iStore integrates with iPayments for credit card processing.
    iMarketing integrates with iStore to present different marketing campaigns to customer segments
    Shopping cart purchases are fed to the Order Management application for processing and subsequent receivables processing
    Configurator can be used with iStore to validate the contents of the shopping cart for configured items

Internet Sourcing (PON) Responsibilities
    Sourcing Buyer (SB)
    Sourcing Super User (SBU)
    Sourcing Supplier (SS) - used by Supplier contacts to respond to RFP/RFI/Auctions

Internet Sourcing (PON) Tips and Tricks:
    You cannot do supplier self registration through the Sourcing Supersuser responsibility - must go to separate URL for self registration
    You can register any supplier in Oracle as an iSupplier by creating and associating an iSupplier user through Supply Base in Purchasing Superuser (Register Supplier User)
    Standard PO's or blanket PO's can be automatically generated from the results of an sourcing auction or RFx or offer activity
    Registration of user contacts populates the TCA tables whereas normal supplier contact maintenance in core does not - must use self registration forms

Internet Sourcing (PON) Notes:
    There are three types of sourcing negotiations: RFX, Auction/Bid and Offer/Counteroffer
    RFX (involves RFI to qualify suppliers and RFQ to get quotations) are for complex configure-to-order items - takes days or weeks to complete
        An RFI is a Request for Information - a request for basic background information on an potential supplier
        An RFI is processed before an RFQ is sent in order to qualify the supplier for minimum commercial standards before issuing an invitation to bid.
    Auction/Bid are for standard items that can be competitively bid - takes only hours to complete
    Offers and counteroffers are between a single buyer and single seller for unique items where price needs to be negotiated/discovered between buyer and seller
    Negotiation styles can be: Open (auction), blind (auction, RFQ and Offer), and Sealed (Auction, RFQ)
    Sourcing can result in a purchase order or blanket agreement but not a catalog quotation, because a catalog quotation is not a commitment to buy
    Events are collections of auctions that occur at the same time - a group of related auctions or RFQ's. They help to monitor multiple RFQ's at once, as related activities
    Price elements are components of negotiation items. Price elements can include training, installation, consulting and related services. They can be negotiated as part of the RFQ
    Scores between 1 and 100 are based on attributes and weighted scores are the sum of scores multiplied by their individual weights
    Do Register Supplier User -> Purchasing Superuser/Supply Base/Supplier User Management/Register Supplier User

Internet Sourcing (PON) Notes on Supplier and Supplier User Registration
    Run the 'get org hash' key process in Unix to create a hash key web page to register a supplier and supplier user
    Alternatively, set up a supplier through forms and then register a user against the supplier
    Exercise: Register Supplier User -> Purchasing Superuser/Supply Base/Supplier User Management/Supplier User Creation/Register Supplier User (note - click 'search' w/out trying to enter a match string)

Internet Sourcing (PON) Notes on RFQ's in Core vs Sourcing
    RFQ's can be generated from requisitions in the Core Applications for a core RFQ or a Sourcing RFQ
    To choose sourcing RFQ in the Autocreate process for core requisitions, set the profile option PO: Allow Autocreation of Oracle Sourcing Docments = "Yes"

Internet Sourcing (PON) Notes on Collaboration Teams:
    Each person identified on a collaboration team as an approver must approve an RFI or RFQ before it can be published.

Internet Sourcing (PON) Notes on Events:
    You must future date the start of an even when you create it, or the event will be deemed to have started and will not show up in the event list on the RFQ/RFI definition page
    If an RFx or auction is attached to an event, it cannot be opened any earlier than the event open date, and the 'open immediately' option for the RFx is disabled

Internet iSupplier Portal (POS) Tips and Tricks:
    You must enable self registration for every organization in 11.5.9 to allow suppliers to register themselves

Internet Supplier Portal (POS) Profile Options:
    POS: External Responsibility Flag - assign to responsibilities
        to allow those responsbilities to be assigned to external users
        through the Administration page for external supplier userss

Internet Supplier Portal (POS) Notes:
    The scope of iSupplier Portal includes the complete procure to pay process:
        Registration - suppliers can enter their own details
            email preferences can be used to set HTML mail delivery method for notifications.
        RFQ's - suppliers can download requests and submit quotations
        Forecast and Planning Schedules - suppliers can view forecast demand
        Purchase Orders - suppliers can view and amend purchase orders
        ASN's - suppliers can advise shipments
        Receipts and Invoices - suppliers can view receipts and enter invoice
        RMA's - suppliers can enter RMA's requested by the receiver or buyer
    Self registration allows suppliers to apply for access
        Workflow routes the approval of the registration request
    Suppliers can download RFQ's and complete and send back RFQ responses
        Responses can be imported via Oracle EDI Gateway
    Forecast schedule information is viewable by the supplier
        They can see the buyer's forecast requirements scheduled needs for an item.
    Suppliers can view purchase orders on the portal and enter ASN's
        This eliminates the discrepencies of matching PO's to receipts
            (short ships, back orders and substitutions)
        Delivery promise dates can be entered and modified via by the supplier
    Self billing invoices (ERS invoices) can be accessed by suppliers on the portal
        It allows suppliers to see payment amounts
    Forecasts are plans, arranged by MRP schedules, over time horizons,
        They communicate future needs.
        You can click any schedule number link and see more detailed information
    Suppliers can post their capacity constraints online
        Buyers use the information to reallocate sourcing percentages for ASL's
    Suppliers can view inventory levels at the buying organizations warehouses
        This includes directly managing VMI subinventories.
        They can manage reorder points and initiate VMI resupply
    Return Merchandise Authorities can be entered on the portal by suppliers to support returns

Internet Supplier Portal (POS) Notes on Planning:
    The planning tab will not appear unless the manufacturing applications are installed
    You can export a schedule from the planning window
        Use the 'export' button underneath the table of planning schedules

Internet Support (iSupport) Notes:
    Includes knowledgebases for customer issues resolution, as well as self submission of tickets

Internet Time (iTime) Notes:
    Time can be recorded against project numbers for project accounting
        This includes project, task and expenditure type (ie character of expense or commodity)
    Time cards can be copied from previous weeks and edited, modified, to speed up time entry
    Time cards can be self approved in workflow or routed to approvers for explicit review and approval

Internet Time (iTime) Notes:
    Verify each employee has a valid assigment in HR linking to a position and job
    Setup approval hierarchy for workflow approval, or default self approval.

Installation Notes on Seed Data Replication Process
    Run the process 'Replicate Seed Data' after creating a new operating unit
        This copies seeded data such as document types to the new OPU
        Not much can be done without performing this step
        In 11i this function was performed by the ADADMIN option upon multi-org upgrade
        ADADMIN disappears from the screen after it is first run

Inventory (INV Schema) Responsibilities:
    INVENTORY, VISION OPERATIONS (USA) (IVO)
    Inventory - Inventory Superuser or just 'Inventory' ISU

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Troubleshooting
    Message "No Organizations are currently defined" requires inventory organization security access
        The current responsibility must be granted access to the inventory organization in inventory
        Navigation -> Inventory/Setups/Organizations/Organization Access/
            and choose the applications and responsibilities that should have access to the organization
    If an inventory organization is not assigned to a responsibility, it is available globally
        Once it is assigned to a responsibility, no other responsibilities have access unless they are specifically assigned also

Inventory (INV Schema) Best Practices:
    Set all but one segments of the system item key flex field to value set validation
        Only one segment needs to be non-validated to make the item number unique
    Centralize the process of item numbering and category and catalog assignment within the organization
        This ensures consistancy in the numbering scheme
        It also ensures master level attributes are established fully when the item is created
        Oracle Inventory does not support mass changes and mass updates
    Define a single master inventory organization for each set of books throughout the business group.
        Without this control duplicate items may be created.
    Test inventory item template definitions before using them
        to identify any inconsistancies in the template definitions
    Use templates to create new items instead of copying existing items and their attributes
        Items may have errors that will be propogated throuh the system
    Put template names in one attribute of the item created by the template
        Tis way it is possible to track back to the creating template for an item
    Prefix item template names with an organization abbreviation
        to differentiate them from seeded templates.
    Define a separate name for each group of possible inventory status codes
        Use this name during item data conversion to automatically set each individual status
    Define a category set for each subledger area rather than reuse one or two sets for multiple purposes
        This will provide a context field for additional DFF information on items
        It is specific to each application area (eg name of price manager)
    Cycle count physical inventory for a few hours per day when shipping and receiving activity is low
        This will maintain a continuous inventory counting program
        It does not interfer with normal operations
        It allows using experienced warehouse staff
    Use alerts to warn of excessive transactions held in the standard interface import tables
    Set 'Transfer Detail go the GL' in the organization parameters during testing
        to tie back cost transactions. Disable this parameter in production

Inventory (INV Schema) Tips and Tricks:
    Check the UOM when creating an item.
        Once an item is saved the UOM field cannot be changed (easily).
        The primary UOM is on the main region of the item window.
    Update the price and buyer information on the purchasing region of the inventory item
        if you create the item by copying another item
    The list price on an inventory item can be used on a purchase order
        if there is no price in Purchasing
            no catalog quote,
            no blanket agreement,
            no requisition template priced lines
            no external price catalog uploads for the item
    Always review these attributes after creating an item:
        Asset Number,
        Description,
        Unit of Measure,
        User Item Type,
        Item Status,
        Category
    Accounting periods must be opened in inventory before transactions can be posted
        This includes transactions such as Costs or Receipts

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Terminology
    QuickCodes (or Quick Codes) - static lists of values for form fields
        The value name is separate to the underlying value field or code
        The value name can be changed without impacting the underlying field

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    Inventory Organizations represent geographical facilities with multiple warehouses
        One inventory organization can be associated with many locations
            But one location or address can be assigned to EITHER just one inventory organization (as explained above)
                OR all orgs (by leaving the above field blank).
            Navigation: Inventory > Setup > Organizations > Locations Query the location(s) and go to Other Details tab.
                Enter the name of the org that you want to assign this location to.
        Inventory Organizations are specific to an operating unit.
        An inventory organization cannot be used by two operating units
        Attributes of inventory items can be differently defined for each inventory organization
            Even though there is one master inventory organization for an operating unit.
            Inventory Organization attributes are defined on the MTL_ORGANIZATION_PARAMETERS table
            Related tables that store additional attributes are:
                GL_CODE_COMBINATIONS - for accounting defaults
                HR_ALL_ORGANIZATION_UNITS - for operating units, organization names
                MTL_PICKING_RULES
                BOM_CALENDARS - for manufacturing calendars
                MTL_ATP_RULES - for ATP processing rules
        Most Master Inventory attributes can be overridden at the Inventory Organization level.
    Sub-Inventories are warehouses or storage areas within an inventory organization
        Sub inventories are defined in MTL_SECONDARY_INVENTORIES
        Items are associated with subinventories in MTL_ITEM_SUB_INVENTORIES
        They can be areas of a warehouse that serve a specific purpose
        Use of Sub-Inventories is optional
        Navigation <Inventory Superuser>/Setup/Organizations/Subinventories
        Sub-Inventory attributes help define the purpose of their contained items:
            available to promise,
            nettable against demand,
            reservable against orders,
            assets or expensed items,
        Major Sub-Inventories would include:
            sellable items, manufactured items etc.
        Other Sub-Inventory examples include:
            returned items waiting inspection,
            materials in transit,
            goods consigned from the supplier
        Sub-Inventory definitions are difficult to change once they have been defined or converted
    Locators or stock locators are areas within a warehouse or Sub-Inventory
        A stock locator is a Key Flexfield typically defined in four segments
            warehouse (facility or outside area),
            aisle (horizontal dimension),
            rack (segment of the aisle) and
            bin (vertical dimension for stacked bins)
        A stock locator can also be defined as a one segment KFF for ease of use
            The intelligence of aisle, rack, and bin can be built into the value set of the KFF
        Stock locators must be unique within an organization
            Oracle does not differentiate locators between different Sub-Inventories
        Additional detail inventory tracking within stock locator can be lot control and serial control

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on the Master Inventory Organization:
    There is one master inventory organization for an operating unit
        One Master Inventory Organization can be shared across multiple operating units as well
        The Master Inventory Organization maintains a master record of all items
            The master records are shared across multiple inventory organizations
    Every inventory organization referencing a master organization must share the same set of books
        This is because default accounts are determined at the master organization level
            Default accounts include: expense, encumbrance sales, cost of goods sold
    Subledger applications can operate with multiple inventory organizations within an operating unit
        Examples are purchasing and order management.
    Manufacturing applications operate within a single inventory organization
        Applications in Receiving (within purchasing)
    Inventory Organizations are most typically modelled to represent a distribution point
        multiple warehouses at the Distribution Center are set up as Sub-Inventories
    Supplier part numbers can be cross referenced to the system item key flexfield number
        Part numbers are then referenced on requisitions and purchase orders
    Movements between inventory organizations can be designated as intransit or direct
    Internal orders allow movements of items between inventory organizations in different operating units
        They are not required for movements between inventory orgs in the same OPU.
        They are initiated by internal requisitions in one operating unit
        They create internal sales orders in the shipping organization
        The Sales Order type is defined in Purchasing Options for the OU, which links to the AR Transaction Type
            The AR Transaction Type can have its 'Default Tax Classification' flag unset to disable tax calculation

            Note 1384716.1 - R12: What Are The Steps Required To Setup An Internal Requisition In Purchasing?
        Shipping networks can be direct or intransit - direct provide for immediate transfers
            Intransit move the inventory based on inter-org ship times
        They also establish accounting codes to charge transfers, in transits and losses
        Shipping networks allow movements/transfers of inventory between organizations
            However transit times must be setup otherwise the movements are immediate
            Additionally, Sourcing rules must be setup to enable scheduling and planning for internal orders
            Without internal requests/orders, all delivery requests are deemed to be needed immediately
                i.e. they become simple inter-org transfers

    Status codes drive the different ways items can be used in the Oracle applications
        Status codes are highly interdependent
            There are a small subset of combinations that are actually appropriate
        Status codes are:
            Stockable - the item can be held in stock (can only be enabled if 'Inventory Item' is enabled)
            Build in WIP,
            Transactable - allows inventory transactions (item must be stockable to enable this flag)
            Purchasable,
            Internal Orders Enabled,
            Customer Orders Enabled,
            Invoice Enabled, and
            BOM Allowed
    Deleting an inventory item requires definition of a 'delete group'
        The item is moved to the delete group prior to deletion
        Items must be deleted from child organizations first
        Only then can the items be deleted from the master organization
    Deletion of an item is intended for deleting where the item is an error
        It is not intended to delete items with transaction history.
    Balance inquiry can be done in the:
        "View Item Quantities" form,
        "View Sub-Inventory Quantities" form, and
        "View Locator Quantities" form
    Supply and demand balances can be viewed in the "View Supply-Demand" form
    Inventory item revision levels can be changed directly in Inventory, however ...
        They are normally updated through Engineering with an ECO and change to the BOM
    Inventory allows for issues, receipts and inventory tracking within a warehouse by project
        This supports project costing and the interface to the Oracle Projects system
    Move Orders are generated are by subledger systems such as Order Management (picking moves)
        Move orders are nominations to move inventory between subinventories in an organization
        They can be input directly into inventory too.
        If planner approval is required, the move order will enter the planner approval queue.
        Autoapproval will execute the move order immediately
        Move orders provide two step processing of inventory moves - request and approve
            Moves can be requested by one person, but controlled and transacted by another.
    Attachments can be made to items in inventory
        Attachments can be notes or drawings or other electronic documents
    There is no change control or security associated with document attachments
        So attachments are a convenience but not a control point.

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Transaction Types
    Transaction Types identify a transaction action and transaction source type
        The combination defines a transaction type
        E.g.
            Action: Issue from Stores
            Source Type: Job or Schedule
            Transaction Type: WIP Component Issue
    Transaction Actions are seeded in FND_LOOKUP_VALUES with LOOKUP_TYPE = MTL_TRANSACTION_ACTION
    Transaction Source Types are in INV.MTL_TXN_SOURCE_TYPES
    See http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/A60725_05/html/comnls/us/inv/trntype.htm for a list of transaction types

    Inter-organization transfers are transfers between inventory organizations
    They can be direct or in-transit
        Direct transfers occur immediately upon entry
            They do not require receiving at the destination
            Both the shipment and receipt occur at the same time and date
        In-transit transfers take time - defined by inter-org transit times
            The in-transit method is used when transportation delays are significant
            In-transit transfers post to in-transit inventory accounts
                If the transfer is FOB then the receiving organization owns the in-transit inventory
                If the transfer is 'Delivered' the shipping organization owns the inventory
            They must be received by the receiving organization to be completed
    Shipping Methods must be defined for Interorganization Transfers
    You can set up a shipping network to support inter-org transfers of items
        This is the minimum setup required to enable inter-org transfer transactions
        Shipping networks include shipping methods and ledger accounts
            The accounts for the from/to orgs default from the Inventory Org Parameters setups
            They can be over-ridden at the shipping network level
            Accounts include:
                Transfer Credit - transfer charges booked to the shipping organization expense account
                Purchase Price Variance - an expense account if standard costing is used
                Payable - the GL liability account charged to the receiving organization
                Receivable - the GL asset account charged to the shipping organization
                Intransit Inventory - the intransit asset account to hold instransit values
    You need to set up inter-org transit times to additionally calculate shipping delays in transfers
    You need to set up sourcing rules if internal requisitions/orders are created using supplier scheduling
        Internal requisitions allow 'need-by'dates and support internal invoicing if needed
        Need by dates in turn support MRP and MPS planning - otherwise transfers are all 'immediate'
    Key tables for inter-organization transfers are:
        MTL_INTERORG_SHIP_METHODS - associate shipping methods with carriers and transit times
        MTL_INTERORG_PARAMETERS - attach accounting rules for transfers between orgs
        WSH_SHIP_METHODS - hold the master shipping method entries
        MTL_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS - stores the actual movement transactions

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Available to Promise (ATP)
    ATP rules comprise computation, time fence and supply/demand sources
    Tables used in ATP are:
        MTL_ATP_RULES
        The ETRM for Inventory contains a sub-schema for all the ATP tables

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Material Transactions
    Inventory transactions can be created directly in Inventory or from feeder systems:
        Order Management
        Purchasing
        Work in Process
    All inventory transactions are store in the MTL_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS table
        There is a subschema diagram in the ETRM for Miscellaneous Transactions
    Material Transaction Distributions are Created by the Cost Manager
        If the cost manager is not running, they are not created
        Check Inventory Superuser > Setup > Transactions > Interface Managers (Tools > Launch) if inactive

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Demand and Reservations
    Material Demand tracks demand placed on inventory for ATP and Planning purposes
        MTL_DEMAND contains three different row types
            Summary Demand - total of unreserved and reserved demand
            Open Demand - unreserved demand
            Reservations - representing a firm promise
    Inventory writes a unique sales order identifier into MTL_SALES_ORDERS
        after entry of demand from the new sales order into MTL_DEMAND or MTL_DEMAND_INTERFACE
    Demand and reservations from sales orders are either automatically entered by Oracle Order Entry
        (if the reservation is placed online)
        or loaded from MTL_DEMAND_INTERFACE, where external demand may be defined.
    Inventory adjusts reservation information in MTL_DEMAND after execution of material transactions.
    Primary tables for Demand and Reservations include:
        MTL_DEMAND - links sales orders to inventories and holds reservations
            Holds sales orders demand and reservations
        MTL_DEMAND_INTERFACE - interface table for demand from outside resources
            This is a temporary storage area for external demand sources

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Practical Exercises
    Exercise: Define Organization Parameters -> IVO/Setup/Organization/Parameters
        To set all parameters and accounts and negative inventory flags for each inventory organization
    Exercise: View Material Transactions -> <Inventory>/Transactions/Material Transactions
    Exercise: View transactions in the Inventory Transactions Open Interface ->
        <Inventory>/Transactions/Transaction Open Interface
    Exercise: Purge Material Transactions -> <Inventory>/Transactions/Purge
        Transactions may only be purged from closed periods
            Installations often 'never close' Inventory to keep transactions accessible
        Once purged, material transactions are lost to reconciliation reporting and item geneology
            Accounting information is purged along with the movement information
        Tables purged include MTL_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS and MTL_TRANSACTION_ACCOUNTS
    Exercise: Make a subinventory transfer -> IVO/Transactions/Subinventory Transfer
        To move inventory between subinventories, or from one locator to another.
        Choose type = 'Subinventory Transfer'
    Exercise: Record a miscellaneous transaction -> IVO/Transactions/Miscellaneous Transactions
        To make a miscellaneous receipt or issue or scrap.
        You can choose to do the transaction by alias (name for account) or enter the actual accounts
        Enter the accounts to offset the inventory account tied to the subinventory - eg expense account
    Exercise: Enter a move order -> IVO/Move Orders/Move Orders
        Record the move order and account to charge (eg expenses for an issue)
    Exercise: Transact a move order -> IVO/Move Orders/Transact Move Orders,
        find the move orders, select using the checkbox and then click 'Transact'
    Exercise: Correct a receipt or delivery transaction -> IVO/Transactions/Receiving/Corrections
        Enter a negative quantity after finding the original transaction to undo the error
    Exercise: View On-Hand Quantities -> IVO/On-hand,Availability/On-Hand Quantity
        Enter the items to view, click subinventory to see quantites at the subinventory level
    Exercise: View Supply/Demand Quantities -> IVO/On-Hand,Availability/Supply,Demand
        To view quantities on hand, due from PO, due in from mfg, and reserved for shipment out
    Exercise: Attach a document to a master item -> IVO/Items/Master Items,
        Query an item to attach documents. Click on the paperclip

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Organization and Hierarchy Security
    Inventory Organization hierarchies are established through organization definition form
    Inventory organizations can be restricted through organization security
        A user with a responsibility can only see inventory organizations assigned to the responsiblity
    Exercise: Assign Inventory Orgs to parent Inventory Orgs ->
        <Inventory>/Setup/Organizations/Organizations
        Query Organization, choose Inventory Org Classification
            Click 'Others', 'Inventory Information'
    Exercise: Assign inventory organization security to responsibilities ->
        <Inventory>/Setup/Organizations/Organization Access
        Assign inventory organizations to application responsibilities
            to limit access and lookup lists
    Inventory Organization Security is also possible using Security Groups in HR
        The Global Super HRMS Manager Responsibility must be used
        Navigation: Global Super HRMS Manager > Security > Global Profile
            Create Security Groups with entries of Organizations with classifications 'Inventory Organization'
            Assign the Security Groups to responsibilities

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Item Templates:
    Items can be created by cloning from other items or using Item Templates
        in the Master Inventory Organization
    Templates are predefined sets of attributes
        that can be reused to reliably create items.
    Templates make initial definition easier
        Seeded Oracle templates have one template and one matching user item type defined.
    Item Templates can default attributes for items during item creation.
    Templates can be defined for the master organization or for a child organization.
        Leave the Org blank on a template to make it a master template available to all organizations
    Items attributes set on templates can have 'Item Level' control
        Those attributes are controlled at the item level across all organizations.
    Items set with item/org level control can be modified within each inventory organization
    Oracle dictates certain selected items must be maintained at the item master org level
        Others are maintained at the Item/Org level.
            The control level for other attributes are driven by setup during the implementation
    The standard approach to creating an item from a template is to name the item
        then select a template (from the options menu ... copy)
        It is possible to select and apply multiple templates for a single item
            Overlay each template successively.
        Any overlapping attributes will be overlaid in the process
    For each item, a template is needed at the master inventory organization level
        This creates the master item
        Another template is needed at the child inventory organization level
            This creates/overlays the child organization level item and attributes
    Multiple templates can be applied to a single item cumulatively.
        The most recent template takes precedence if it overlaps another template value
    The template form has an alternate region switch
        The template values must be set for each alternate region starting with 'main'
            These regions correspond with the alternate regions on the item definition form
    Exercise: Create an item template ->
        <Inventory>/Setup/Items/Templates, and create a named template.
        Leave Org blank if it is a master org template
        Set the control level for each attribute to the master level.
            Attributes won't show for applications not yet installed
    You can also create an item by copying another item and applying templates
        Oracle will copy the item first and apply the template second.
    Fields to update on the purchasing region after copying an item are:
        list price
        receipt required
        purchased flag
        purchasable flag
        default buyer
        receipt close tolerance
        taxable flag
        expense account

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Importing Items
    Run Import Items to import items through the Open Item Interface from any source
        This can be run from an inventory responsibility via Items -> Import -> Import Items
    Tables used are:
        MTL_SYSTEMS_ITEM_INTERFACE
        MTL_ITEM_REVISIONS_INTERFACE - to import revisions to existing items
        MTL_INTERFACE_ERRORS - tracks errors that arise during the import

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Setups:
    System Item Key Flexfield Definition (primary item key)
    Item Attributes cannot be changed once the items are transacted
        item attribute setups are key to how they are processed.
        This is a special risk for phased implementations
            where design decisions may create the need for attribute changes down the road

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Item Types and Items:
    Inventory items can have attributes defined and controlled at the master level or the organization level.
        Master level centralizes control of these attributes
    Items can be tangible goods or intangibles
        Intangibles include magazine subscriptions or labor services sold as items
    Items can be defined in a parent/master organization and inherited down to child organizations.
        Item attributes can be overridden at the child level
    Items can be assigned to all child organizations
        An Organization Assignment Form button 'Assign All' does this
    Items can be phantom assemblies which are never stocked
        They represent a common 'build' of components referenced in multiple Bills Of Material
    Item numbers can be prefixed or suffixed (more common) with a lot number if lots are tracked.
    The Inventory Item Id Key Flexfield must be defined to cover all items in all inventories
    You must create items in the inventory master organization
        Choosing a responsibility with access to the master organization
    Exercise: Create a master item by copying another item or template -> use the Tools/Copy menu
    Exercise: Create an Item Type -> <Inventory>/Setup/Items/Item Types
        Create item types to associate with items (finished goods, suppliers etc).
        Material overhead costs are charged to items at the item type level.
        Item types cannot be changed or deleted once used.
    Exercise: Create a Master Item and assign to Inventory Organizations ->
        <Inventory>/Items/Master Items (ensure responsibility has access to the master organization)
            Enter the Item ID, then choose "Tools/Copy From" to use a template or other item
                Then choose Tools/Organization assignment, to assign orgs that will have this item
    Exercise: Enter an Inventory Item -> <Inventory>/Items/Master Items/Menu/Tools/Copy From,
        Choose the template to copy and give the item a new number/code and description
        Choose "Menu/Tools/Organization Assigment" and choose organizations to assign
        Choose "Menu/Tools/Categories" and assign to a Category Set or Category
    Exercise: Delete an item -> Inventory/Items/Delete Items
        Define a Delete Group (type items) and add items to the Delete Group.
        Run 'Check Groups' to see what items cannot be deleted and why
        e.g. an item has an inventory balance or pending sales order

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Purchasing Alternate Region in Items:
    The 'Purchased' attribute is an item-defining attribute that defines an item as 'existing' for purchasing.
        It also allows the 'purchasable' attribute to be turned on
    The 'Purchasable' attribute allows temporary disabling of an item from being purchased
        This attribute can be turned off for this purpose.
        It must be turned on to allow purchasing (including in purchase orders)

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Locations:
    Exercise: Define a location -> <Inventory>/Setup/Organization/Location
        Define locations and define activities allowable at each location.

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Accounting:
    Inventory requires numerous account setups which should be fully tested prior to go-live
    Accounting for inventory receipts involves three steps:
        Purchase Order (encumber budget and PO with commitment and relieve when received)
            This step is optional and the encumbrance is one-sided without accounting impact
        Receive Goods (Accrue Purchase and Debit Inventory with receipt
            The encumbrance is removed
            Inventory is debited with the cost of goods received at the time received
        Receive Supplier Invoice (relieve purchase accrual and record payable liability)
        Pay invoice (relieve payable and reduce cash)
    Variance accounts post the difference in prices that occurs in each step of the purchasing chain.
        Accounts are:
            Purchase Price Variance (variance between purchase order and receipt cost)
            Invoice Price Variance (variance between receipt cost and invoice cost)
            Both variance accounts are liability accounts offset by final payment
    Variances are relieved by posting to inventory periodically
        Standard costs are adjusted to eliminate systematic variances for future transactions.
    Average costing modifies the cost of each item with each receipt
        This is done when the cost is debited to the inventory account at the time of receipt
    Standard costing keeps items costs fixed (inventory is charged the same cost)
        The difference is posted to a Purchase Price Variance (PPV) Account
    Exercise: Open or view inventory accounting periods ->
        <Inventory>/Accounting Close Cycle/Inventory Accounting Periods

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Month-End (Period-End) Close Processing:
    ...

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Lot and Serial Control:
    Lots are sets of the same item that are tracked with a common expiration date.
        They are usually manufactured at the same time and have the same quality characteristics
    Lots are identified by Lot Number and tagged with an Expiration Date.
        They are useful in tracking goods with a limited shelf life
    Lot numbers also provide tracking for quality analysis
        Purchasing can receive lot numbers,
        Inventory can store against lots
        Discrete Manufacturing (not flow) can pull lot numbered items
    Actions that can be performed with Lots include:
        viewing,
        reviewing their material transactions
        lots can be disabled,
        and their expiration dates can be changed
            all through the Oracle Forms
        Exercise: View Lots -> <Inventory>/On-hand,Availability/Lots
            and find by Lot# or by Item# (all lots with the item will be displayed).
            Update expiration dates, view transactions and disable lots.
            You can also view lot geneology in BOM format
    Serial provide unique identification of individual units of the item
        They can be generated sequentially
    Serial numbers can be generated for any item
        This includes finished assemblies, parts within assemblies and non- assembly items
    Serial numbers can be predefined with a sequence and prefix for an individual item
        They can be pre-generated to create a list of valid values for subsequent use
        To generate serial numbers, the item must be setup at the org level for serial control
            This is an attribute (look on the Inventory Alternate Region of the Item Attribute)
        Exercise: Generate Serial Numbers -> Inventory/On-hand,Availability/Generate Serial Numbers
    Serial numbering of assemblies and components is tracked with barcoding or serial number
        Serial numbers can be entered into Oracle Forms
    Serial numbers are used in other Oracle apps:
        Service with warranty terms, inspection, customer RMA's.
    Serial numbers are also maintained for items in Purchasing and WIP modules

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Units of Measure:
    Unit of Measure classes group similar units of measure
        Units in a class can be converted to other units in the same class
            Examples classes are volume, weight, temperature, length, capacity
    Every unit of measure class has a base unit of measure.
        Once set and used, the base unit of measure cannot be changed
        You should normally choose the Unit of Issue used by OM as the Base Unit
            This will simplify system usage
    Unit of measure conversion factors can be defined as universal item specific
    The default UOM for Order Management is the Unit of Issue
    Key tables in Units of Measure include:
        MTL_UNITS_OF_MEASURE (and _TL)
        MTL_UOM_CLASSES (and _TL)
        MTL_UOM_CONVERSIONS
        MTL_UOM_CLASS_CONVERSIONS
        MTL_SYSTEM_ITEMS_B

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Replenishment:
    Inventory supports several replenishment and safety stock replenishment methods
        These algorithms take manufacturing and sales demand into account.
        One method is Re-Order Point (ROP)
            ROP uses safety stock and economic order quantity concepts (EOQ)
            It calculate replenishment orders, and it also factors in expected demand.
            Time buckets are established in the ROP method
            Inside each time bucket the supply and demand are balanced to ensure proper matching
            MRP keeps Inventory updated with the status of material requirements
            It factors in expected demand for BOM components through the INV_SUPPLY table
            Inventory takes these into account when calculating reorder quantities
        Another method is Min-Max
            This method places an order when minimum inventory is reached
            It sized the order to restore inventory to the maximum value
            Min-Max planning is 'point in time' and does not factor in demand

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Category Sets:
    References:
        Metalink Note: 423551.1 How To Create Category Sets and Assign Items to Categories
        http://docs.oracle.com/cd/A60725_05/html/comnls/us/inv/categasn.htm#t_asgncateg - different methods of assigning items to categories
    Category sets (Inventory Item Category Setups) are named collections of category values for a specific category KFF structure
        A category structure will have assigned categories
        A category set is a named collection of categories within the structure (a subset of the full category list)
        Oracle supports more that one list of categories (i.e. sets) and each supported list is defined in a named (separate) set
        Items fall under categories under category sets and multiple sets are allowed.
        In other words ...
            Define an inventory category structure
            Define a list of category values for the structure - this creates all possible values for the structure
            Define a category set for the structure, and populate it with a subset of the categories
            Define additional category sets as needed
    Category Sets allow multiple category structures for internal reporting and data entry
        Category Sets comprise lists of Categories
        Each Category Set specifies a Category Key Flexfield
            Different Category Key Flexfields can be defined and assigned to different Category Sets
    Category Sets group categories for different purposes:
        engineering,
        purchasing, etc.
    Oracle seeds seven inventory category sets to support sub-ledger applications:
        Inventory,
        Purchasing,
        Order Management,
        Service, Engineering,
        Costing
        Planning
    The Purchasing Category Set groups items under purchasing categories such as commodity lines.
        Buyers can be grouped to Categories within this Category Set
    The Order Management Category Set is used to set sales discounts by category, run sales reports, and to report sales backlog.
    A Default Category set must be assigned to each of the seven key subledger areas within Oracle:
        Inventory,
        Purchasing,
        Order Management
        Service,
        Engineering,
        Costing
        Planning
    Every Category Set must identify a default category.
        The Open Item Interface assigns default categories to items as they are loaded
            This happens if specific categories are not named in the interface data.
    Category Sets can utilize a different flexfield structure for item catalogs for each definition of the set.
    Category Sets and categories should be assigned to items in the master organization (where the item assigment is controlled)
        They cascade down to the child organizations if wanted
    Items are assigned to Category Sets in one of two ways:
        Query the item in the master organization and choose tools from the menu - and assign the item to categories
        Open the Category Set from within the Master Inventory Organization and choose Assignments
            If you are not in the correct inventory organization (the master organization) the Assignment options are read-only
    Key tables in the inventory schema for categories are:
            MTL_ITEM_CATEGORIES - assign items to categories for all flex structures (category sets)
            MTL_CATEGORY_SET_VALID_CATS
            MTL_CATEGORIES_B
            MTL_CATEGORY_SETS_B
            MTL_DEFAULT_CATEGORY_SETS
            FND_ID_FLEX_STRUCTURES
    Exercise: Create a key flexfield structure -> <System Administrator>/Setup/Flexfields/Key/Segments and search for the 'Item Categories' Flexfield
    Exercise: Create category set -> <Purchasing Super User>/Setup/Items/Categories/Category Sets...
    Exercise: View Categories in a Category Set -> <Responsibility>/Inventory/Setup/Categories/Category Codes
        Enter a structure (the KFF "structure" that is associated with a Category Set) to return all values in the Category Set
    Exercise: Add categories to a category set -> <Purchasing Super User>/Setup/Items/Categories/Category Codes
    Exercise: Create a List of Values to assign to a Category Set -> <System Administrator>/Setup/Flexfields/Validation/Sets/
    Exercise: Add values to a value set -> <System Administrator>/Setup/Flexfields/Validation/Values

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Catalogs
    Catalogs are outward serving customer/user-oriented references
        Categories are internal reporting and control references to items.
        Category Groups are used internally by Inventory for reporting purposes
        Descriptors attached to the items make catalogs searchable
    Catalogs provide searchable indexes into items for purchasing and sales
    Catalogs consist of attributes or descriptors (descriptive elements) and catalog groups
        Each Catalog Group can have a different collection of descriptors
    Catalog Groups define the catalog schema and valid item descriptors
        They also define the navigation hierarchy
    Catalogs are helpful for finding items
    Primary tables for Inventory Catalogs are:
        MTL_SYSTEM_ITEMS_B
        MTL_ITEM_CATALOG_GROUPS
        MTL_ICG_ALIASES - item catalog group aliases
        MTL_ICG_CATEGORIES - item catalog group categories or supergroups
        MTL_DESCRIPTIVE_ELEMENTS - assign descriptive elements to catalog groups
        MTL_DESCR_ELEMENT_VALUES - define element values for items within a group
    Exercise: Setup Catalog Groups and item descriptive elements ->
        <Inventory>/Setup/Items/Catalog Groups
            Enter a catalog group and "Show Detail" to add descriptive elements
    Exercise: Search for Catalog Items -> ,Inventory>/Items/Item Search
        Choose Show = "Item Catalog" to search on Catalog Groups and item attributes/descriptors

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Physical Inventory and Cycle Counting ABC Analysis:
    Physical inventory involves an actual count of items in inventory
        It records the physicals against book calculated amounts
    The physical inventory process involves taking a snapshot of inventory
        Physical count tags are printed and actual amounts recorded
        Recounts are issued based on recorded differences
    ABC is setup by defining the Classes (A, B, C etc)
        Compiles are created to build groups of items based on a value definition
        Groups are defined and a compiled list of items is associated to a group
        Finally breakpoints are set for which items belong to each class in the ABC group
    Cycle counting uses the ABC classes to decide how often items get counted
    Tolerances are established for accepting inventory counts that vary from book totals
        They can be different to counts of book value
        A Recount Request is generated if the discrepancy exceeds the tolerance
    Exercise: Create ABC Compiles - <Inventory>/ABC Codes/ABC Compiles
        to define a collection of items based on scope and value criteria
    Exercise: Create ABC Classes -> to establish the number of classes (A, B, C, ....X)
        These will be used for inventory counting
    Exercise: Create ABC Groups and Associate a Compiled List of Inventory Items ->
        <Inventory>/ABC Codes/ABC Assignment Groups
        to create groups of inventory items that will be cycle counted
        cyles will use ABC value analysis within the group
        a group may cover several subinventories
        You associate the Group with the ABC Compile name here
            This defines the total membership of the group
    Exercise: Assign ranges of items to ABC Classes in the Group ->
        <Inventory>/ABC Codes/Assign Items to define the items within the group as members of each value tier (A, B, C)
        This is done by entering the sequence number of the last item in the group as the 'breakpoint' for the group.
        The form shows the total count of items in the group and the percentag of value in each assignment

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Functional Gaps:
    The Return Material Authorization (RMA) process
        Disassembly and restocking of configured Assemble-to-Order items are not supported

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Standard Reports:
    ABC Descending Values - sorts items in descending order of ABC critical value for tight control
    ABC Assignments Report - shows current assignments of items to ABC inventory value categories

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Interfaces:
    The Interface Managers form sets the frequency of background workers importing interface transactions.
    Set interface processing frequency -> <Inventory>/..../Launch Interface Managers
        to set the frequency of import for major interface processes (from say, RF devices).
        Processes include: Cost Manager, Lot Move, Material Transaction, Move Transaction.
    Open Items Import -> by loading the MTL_SYSTEM_ITEMS_INTERFACE table
        Run a process to load the items into MTL_SYSTEM_ITEMS.
        The process to load the items from the interface table
        It checks the settings on item attributes to validate their consistancy.
        Import in two passes starting with the master organization items
        This is followed by the child organization items.
        Specify a template for each import to stamp the appropriate attribute values
    Open Transactions Import -> in the MTL_TRANSACTIONS_INTERFACE
        to bring in transactions and opening balances for inventories
        Opening Balances are imported as Miscellaneous Receipts
        These are loaded into MTL_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS for processing.

Inventory (INV Schema) Notes on Key Tables:
    APPS.ORG_ACCESS_V -- organization access view
    BOM_CALENDARS - BOM or inventory calendars for an inventory organization
    MTL_ATP_RULES - rules for Available to Promise for each inventory organization

        including manufacturing and sales
    MTL_ITEM_CATEGORIES
    MTL_ITEM_REVISIONS
    MTL_ITEM_QUANTITIES_VIEW - counts all available quantities in an inventory
        counts across lots and serial numbers
    MTL_ITEM_LOCATIONS - master table for inventory locators within subinventories
        Locators only exist for subinventories with locator control active
    MTL_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS - stores a record of every material transaction
        Also stores lines for any cost updates in inventory
        Records are inserted by the transaction processor or standard cost update
        Joined to MTL_TRANSACTION_ACCOUNTS for accounting/costing information
        Transfers are represented by two transactions in this table
            They are joined on TRANSFER_TRANSACTION_ID
    MTL_MATERIAL_TRANSACTIONS_TEMP - the gateway for all material transactions
        All inventory transaction forms write directly to this table
        Record are processed from this table to Inventory through the Transaction Processor
        The transactions interface table also writes to this table upon import
    MTL_PARAMETERS - inventory organization parameters
    MTL_PHYSICAL_INVENTORIES - physical inventory definitions

    MTL_PHYSICAL_SUBINVENTORIES - subinventories defined within a physical inventory
    MTL_ONHAND_QUANTITIES - current balances to the subinventory and locator level
        Multiple entries must be summed to get the on-hand balance
        See Metalink Note 92031.1 MTL_ONHAND_QUANTITIES Table - An Overview
        This table creates one record for each receipt
        Disbursements deplete the receipt rows or eliminate them

jInitiator, Java and Browser Setup Notes:
    Browser compatibility is in Metalink Note: 285218.1:
    The Oracle JInitiator plug-in is required to run Oracle Forms as Java applets on the Client.
        jInitiator is a set of class files written in Java to implement Forms functions in a browser
    Starting with R12 jInitiator is no longer needed - the standard Sun JVM is used and installed from the Sun site.
    jInitiator is an ActiveX object running within Microsoft Internet Explorer
        It is a plugin within Netscape Navigator and Mozilla Firefox
            In Firefox you need to place the jinit dll in the Plugins Directory under the Firefox file system.
        Browser security must allow plugins for ActiveX or Oracle Forms will not work
    jInitiator allows running Oracle Developer Server applications within a browser
        It allows the browser to run an Oracle certified version of the JVM instead of the standard JVM
    The Oracle JInitiator plug-in is required to run Oracle Forms as Java applets on the Client.
    jInitiator recent versions include:
        jInitiator 1.1.8.16 available through patch 5300474
        jInitiator 1.3.1.12 availabel through patch 4392066
    See Metalink Note 162488.1 for Jinit 1.1.8 Troubleshooting
    Download jInitiator from Metalink note: 124606.1 or patch Patch 5300474
    Launch the install .exe from under the C: drive or desktop.
        It won't launch from deep in the file system because it cannot handle long file paths
    The path for jInitiator is C:\Program Files\Oracle\JInitiator<version>\
        There are readme files in these directories with instructions on managing jInitiator setups
    For version 1.1.18.16 there is a cache directory at C:\Program Files\Oracle\JInitiator 1.1.8.16\jcache
        There is another cache for 1.3.1.21 at C:\Documents and Settings\gjarman\Oracle Jar Cache
        Use the control panel utility for jInitiator to clear the jar cache
    There is a control panel entry for jInitiator (Programs\Settings\Control Panel and look for the jInitiator Entry)
        This utility can be used to turn off caching or clear the cache
        There is also an entry in the Windows Programs menu to run this control panel utility
    jInitiator may place a text trace file in C:\Documents and Settings\gjarman\ as jinitiator13121.trace
        This trace file is the same as the text log entries in the java console
        The java console can be enabled through the jInitiator Control Panel utility

            How to Setup a Legal Address Using HR Address Formats in R12 Legal Entity Configurator (Doc ID 1104887.1)  end-to-end description of defining, choosing or modifying a style to meet local needs. Also describes creating a custom validation set against HZ_GEOGRAPHIES  so that the list of valid values  setting up an address is the same list used to validate it for tax purposes.
            Can you use the US Address Style in a Shared HR Environment? (Doc ID 1610796.1) recommends disabling the US style so that Oracle uses US_GLB instead (since the US style is intended for a full implementation of HR and a full load of the Vertex HR geography patch
            Can the US Address Style be Disabled? (Doc ID 1394466.1) also recommends disabling the US style if on Shared HRMS and not the full HRMS/Payroll system
            What is the Difference Between The Two Address Forms PERACADR (North American Address) and PERWSADR (Generic Address) (Doc ID 954512.1)  a somewhat related note describing the purpose of the two styles  US is for HR/Payroll.
            No Values In City/County LOV When Creating Legal Address In Legal Entity Manager (Doc ID 1259396.1) recommends removing the validation sets on the US address style but continuing to use the US address style instead of disabling it.
        The LE Address style cannot be chosen at entry - Oracle finds the first valid address style on the 'Location Address' flexfield definition
            Oracle stores the LE Address in the HR_LOCATIONS_ALL table
        eBusiness Tax uses this county in the 'Determine Applicable Regimes' process
        You cannot choose an address style entering and LE address - Oracle picks the first valid style if finds
        If there are two styles it will pick 'US' and not 'US_GLB' (Global/International)
            The 'US' style is defined for HR employee addresses (a domestic US address style) and will throw errors if HR is not fully installed
            The tables used in the validation sets query PAY tables which are loaded with Vertex location codes but only for a full HR install
                PAY_US_CITY_NAMES
                PAY_US_COUNTIES
                PAY_US_STATES
                PAY_US_CITY_GEOCODES
                PAY_US_COUNTIES
                PAY_US_ZIP_CODES
                PAY_US_CITY_SCHOOL_DSTS
                PAY_US_COUNTY_SCHOOL_DSTS
            On a shared HR install these tables are empty so the validations on the 'US' address style need to be removed
                Or unfreeze the flexfield definition and disable the 'US' contect on the 'Location Address' flexfield, then refreeze
                Oracle will choose the next available valid address style 'US_GLB' in Legal Entity Manager

Marketing Notes:
    Marketing is a CRM application that defines marketing programs with potential customers down to the specific product/item opportunity
    Marketing covers presales, leads, identifying prospects, and tracking contacts.
    It is designed for disconnected users and uploading/synchronization when network access is available
    Literature, kits and trial package requests are fulfilled with customers by originating orders for these items and passing through to Order Management
    Relationships between contacts and prospects are also managed as part of the prospect database
    Forecasts based on pipeline likelihood are generated to feed demand forecasting for manufacturing demand planning

Master Scheduling/Material Resource Planning (MRP Schema) Notes:
    MRP plans material requirements in time buckets to the end of a fixed planning horizon
        It generates manufacturing work orders for sub-assemblies and completed products
        It evaluates lead times for purchasing, setup and assembly.
    MRP recommends when to start making items to meet lead time requirements for demand
    MRP translates demands from multiple sources including:
        order management,
        manufacturing schedules,
        inventory restocking etc
    Demands are converted into materials requirements at multiple levels:
        purchased parts,
        finished assemblies and
        intermediate assemblies
    MRP takes into account current inventory levels in meeting future demands
        unless those inventories are designated non-nettable at the subinventory level
    MRP generates planning workorders to manufacturing for assemblies to meet expected demand
        This is done for all stocking strategies
        It issues requisitions to purchasing to supply bought-in parts.
            MRP does not create purchase orders
    MRP Steps are:
        Generate forecasts,
        generate MDS's from Forecasts and Sales Orders,
        generate MPS's from MDS's and inventory,
        generate MRP from MPS.
    Independent demand is demand from forecasts and sales orders
    Dependent demand is calculated from explosion of the bill of materials for an item
    Net Requirements are gross requirements less stock on hand
    The 'Planning Manager' concurrent process performs the following steps:
        consumes forecasts against orders,
        imports forecasts,
        relieves master schedules
    Master Demand Schedules or Master Planning Schedules can be 'loaded' manually
        More often they are loaded from forecasts and orders
    MRP calculates use-up dates as the dates when items will run out
        They can be tied to ECO's to schedule component change-outs
    Kanban means  'card' or 'sign' or 'signal'.
        Create Kanbans by specifying names and demand forecast sources
            Then launch and review results in the workbench
    'Feedback' on an MRP plan definition allows the MRP to evaluate the status of planned orders
        (for deleting planned, not actual orders?)
    Overwrite on MRP options allows firm orders generated by previous plans to be deleted
        This does not delete actual orders
    Orders with compression time in MRP are required to start earlier than the current date
        This is based on lead time and must be compressed
    Order modifiers are min and max order quantities
        They modify the plan generated orders to suppliers or to work order mfg/wIP

Master Scheduling/Material Requirements Planning Profile Options:
    MRP: Cutoff Date Offset Months - establishes the span of months included in the MRP.
        Added to the current date to calc the planning end-date
    MRP: Firm Planned Order Time Fence
        - moves the end date of the 'off-limits' MRP time fence to the date of the most recent firm order
    MRP: Snapshot Workers - number of parallel workers supporting the snapshot MRP multi-threaded process

    Distribution Planner
    Material Planner
    Supply Chain Planner

Master Scheduling/Material Requirements Planning Dependencies:
    An MPS or MDS must be defined and built before running an MRP
        (an MPS will require an MDS) since MRP calculates from and MDS or MPS

Multi-Org (PER) Notes on Organizations, Sets of Books and Organization Hierarchy:
    Multi-org means multiple operating units (OPU's) in a single instance
        Traditionally isolation of multiple AR, AP, PA subledgers required multiple instances
        Multi-Org provides this isolation in a single instance
            Users of one OPU cannot see the business of users in another OPU at the subledger level
    Multi-org supports multiple organizations within a single instance of the applications
    Multi-org was introduced in version 10.6 and became a standard feature with 10.7
        Operating units (OPU's) became a standard feature in release 10.7.
    Multi-org supports multiple sets of books in the General Ledger (although SOB's are not orgs)
        It also allows shipping and selling products between legal entities
            Intercompany billing and accounting for transactions between legal entities is automated
    Multi-org also allows purchasing in one organization and receiving in another organization
        The two organizations must have a common set of books (chart of accounts, currency, calendar)
    Organizations are owned, defined and maintained in the HR scheman (PER)
        However they are shared across all applications that require them

Multi-Org (PER) Notes on Classifications
    Organization Classifications determine what functions the organizations can serve
        One organization can have multiple classifications to serve different purposes
    These classifications include:
        Business Group,
        Legal Entity,
        Operating Unit,
        Inventory Organization
        Project Reporting/Owning Organization,
        Project Expenditure Organization, and
        Asset Organization
    Each classification may have associated flexfields with additional attributes
        These attributes characterize the organization's role within it's classification
        For a Legal entity, a flexfield attribute is used to store the Set of Books it is tied to
        For an Operating Unit, flexfield attributes show the parent Legal Entity (and Set of Books)
            The Set of Books in this case is denormalized - the Legal Entity ties it in.

Multi-Org (PER) Notes on Organization Types and Hierarchies
    The standard multi-org hierarchy top down is:
        Business Group, (Set of Books), Legal Entity, Operating Unit, Inventory Org/Project Org/Asset Org
    Business Group - an employee organization that secures employee information
        There can be one or more Business Groups in a instance of Oracle Applications
        A business group should be defined for each country of operation
            The profile option HR:Cross Business Group allows visibility across different business groups
            The apps come with a seeded "Default" Business Group that can be edited
        This organization is at the top of the organization hiearchy and is the highest org that can be defined
        All employees, organizations and org hiearachies are attached to a business group (one or more)
        The profile option PER_BUSINESS_GROUP_ID identifies a Business Group and ties it to a responsibility
            This profile setting must be assigned to a responsibility before defining lower level organizations
            Oracle stamps every organization defined by the associated responsibility as owned by the Business Group
    Set of books - a financial reporting entity (not an organization) that defines an accounting scheme
        this includes a chart of accounts (accounting flexfield, calendar and currency)
        SOB orgs are defined in the Set of Books setup form in GL
            Navigation: GLSU/Setup/Financials/Books/Define
            Table: GL.GL_SETS_OF_BOOKS
        the balancing segment values on the set of books typically include operating unit organizations
            the balancing segment values are typically a superset of operating units
            many companies are special entities that do business through the operating units
            any operating unit can create transactions to any company in the set of books it is assigned
        Sets of books are needed when there are multiple calendars, currencies or chart of account requirements.
            Companies operating in different countries often require different sets of books
        Sets of books are defined with the variance account for out-of-balance journals
        Sets of books are defined with a Retained Earnings account for year end close of the income statement
            All legal entities use this Retained Earnings account when closing their books
        Everything a user sees in the GL is limited by set of books
            Viewing a different set of books requires a different responsibility.
    Legal Entity - a statutory reporting organization (a legal company)
        each legal entity is assiged to a single set of books for reporting purposes
        typically a legal entity will correspond with a balancing segment (or 'company') value on the chart of accounts
        A legal entity is the lowest level for producing statutory financial and tax reports
            This includes balance sheet and profit and loss statements.
            For non-profits, a legal entity is a fund.
        Legal Entities own the following data and transactions
            Accounting Structures: balancing segments and ledgers
            eBTax Rules
            Bank Accounts
            Payables and Receivables Invoices
            Inter and Intracompany relationships, accounts and processing rules
    Operating Unit - a buying and selling organization (PO, AP, AR, OE)
        each operating unit is assigned to a legal entity and 'inherits' its set of books
            This is the default legal context in R12 where one operating unit can serve multiple legal entities
        multiple operating units mean multiple orgs - they partition data in the subledgers
        the profile option MO: Operating Unit attaches to a responsibility to implement this partitioning
        an operating unit limits what data a user can see and how the data a user enters is striped
        An operating unit is a buying and selling organization within a legal entity.
            Subledger applications are partitioned with operating unit organizations
                A user cannot see purchases and sales across operating units under a single responsibility
            Customers are shared across operating units but their delivery addresses are always within an operating unit
            Suppliers are shared across operating units but their sites are not
            Setups such as lookup codes and payment terms are global - visible across organizations
    inventory org - a cataloging organization within an operating unit
        (comprising an item master org and non-item master (execution) orgs)
        Required by: INV, BOM, ENG, WIP, MRP, MRP and Purchasing/Receiving)
        There should be one master item org for each operating unit
            This is because items have default account setups which imply a set of books
    sub inventory - a subclassification within an inventory organization
    locator - a tagging organization (implemented using a key flexfield).
    In addition to the main org hiearchy the HR and Projects applications allow additional orgs to be defined
        These HR and Projects orgs can be implemented for reporting purposes within each application

Multi-Org (PER) Notes on Profile Options and Responsibilities that make Multi-Org Work
    Implementation of multi-org works behind the scenes for Business Groups (HR), Sets of Books (GL) and Operating Units (Subledgers)
    Once set up, a user chooses a Business Group, Operating Unit and Set of Books implicitly when choosing any responsibility
        The profile option PER_BUSINESS_GROUP_ID assiged to a responsibility establishes the Business Group for HR access
            HR uses the Business Group on the responsibility to stamp any work in HR, including creating more organizations
            This is why you have to explicitly attach a set of books to a Legal Entity and SOB/Legal Entity to an OPU
                HR stamps the Business Group on any new organization when the organziation is setup
            The Business Group organization is what HR uses for all it's work and to stamp all it's transactions and setups
        The profile option: "??: Set of Books" assigned to a responsibility establishes the Set of Books for GL access
            GL uses the Set of Books on the responsibility to stamp any work in GL
            The SOB read from the GL responsibility limits what can be seen in the GL
        The profile option: "MO: Operating Unit" assigned to the responsibility establishes the Operating Unit for subledger access
            Subledger responsibilities use the Operating Unit to stamp any work in the subledgers
            Although a responsibility has may have an OPU and SOB attached to it, each application only looks at it's needed setting
                So conflicting profile options assigned to a single responsibility don't break the system
                Each application only looks at the setting it needs in the responsibility for stamping work
            At user log on, the responsibility sets the operating unit through the MO:Operating Unit profile option
        Subledger tables are striped with an Org_ID if the table name are suffixed with an '_ALL' designation
            The subledger application stamps every subledger transaction with the OPU org in the Org_ID column behind the scenes
            Views/forms off these tables are restricted to the current logged on OPU organization from the responsibility
            This limits the user within the parent organizations for the operating unit
                Legal entity and operating Unit for subledger applications (eg AP, AR etc)
            This is done through a view on the table restricting values based on the ORG_ID column

Multi-Org (PER) Notes on Inventory Organizations, Sub Inventories and Stock Locators
    References
        http://invoraapps.blogspot.com/2012/10/concepts-of-inventory-organization.html
    Inventory organizations are used by manufacturing and inventory applications to track inventory balances and transactions
    Inventory organizations comprise an item-master org and one or more non-item master (execution) orgs
        Inventory organizations are assigned a set of books, operating unit, and a location
            This is done explicitly in the HR Organization form since HR only 'knows' the Business Group
            The Location is a default location (or address)
        Each non-item master org points to an item master org for item validation (see below)
        It is recommended one common master inventory org be defined for all inventory orgs in an Operating Unit
        Item master inventory orgs define catalogs of items within an operating unit
            Sales items have default account setups, so there should be one inventory item validation org for each operating unit
                (or for all units with the same set of books - this is for sales item validation, not purchashing)
            Only items in the master organization can be inherited down to inventory organizations at lower levels
        Item Validation Organizations and Item Master Organizations are Different
            Item Master Organizations are defined in the MTL_PARAMETERS table
                The purpose is to control entry of items into child organizations (it is a grand catalog)
                Navigation: Purchasing Super User > Setup > Organizations > Query an Inventory Org > 
            Item Validation Organizations are defined in Financial Options for the Operating Unit
                Their purpose is to control what can be sold by an Operating Unit
                Navigation: Purchasing Super User > Setup > Organizations > Financial Options
        An execution inventory organization can point to a master item inventory organization in a different operating unit/legal entity/set of books
            So there can be one item master org across all OPU's
            Master Orgs also establish master item attributes, item categories and other master item controlled data
            The default purchasing master inventory org is associated to an operating unit in its financial options.
            The execution inventory org and the operating unit must have the same set of books to be linked
        Inventory execution organizations have inventory transactions and balances and are used for manufacturing applications
            An execution organization is specific to a manufacturing site or distribution center
            One manufacturing location or site can have more than one inventory execution organization
            Inventory execution organizations perform receiving and the sourcing functions in purchasing.
        Manufacturing applications are partitioned by inventory organization
            You cannot see inventory across inventory organizations at one time.
            Oracle will prompt the user for an inventory org when using forms within the manufacturing applications
                This happens after signing on with a responsibility tied to an operating unit organization
        A single inventory organization is assigned to the purchasing options of an operating unit in Organizations/Financial Options.
            Only items in the assigned inventory organization that are purchasable are available for requisitions and purchase orders
        At the shipment and delivery level of a requistion or purchase order, any inventory organization assigned to the operating unit is available for selection
            However the chosen items must exist in the inventory organization
        If the purchasing inventory organization is different to the shipping inventory org on a purchase order ...
            the item must be in both organizations in order to be entered and processed.
        Inventory orgs and OPU's have default locations that can be different
            If different, the OPU assigned location (and any global locations) limit the list of ship-to's that can be chosen in a purchase
        Subinventories are defined as subgroups within an inventory organzition
            Subinventories have asset accounts
        Stock Locators are physical locations within a subinventory
    Navigation: Define organizations -> GLSU/Setup/Organizations/Organizations
    Navigation: Assign an operating unit to a responsibility -> via profile option MO: Operating Unit (for the required responsibility)
    Navigation: Define Set of Books -> GLSU/Setup/Financial/Define

Multi-Org (PER) Notes on Key Tables for Sets of Books and Organization Hierarchy:
    Multi-org tables are suffixed '_ALL' which support unrestricted collections of data across multiple organizations.
        Restricted views don't have the '_ALL' suffix
    Key tables implementing multi-org are:
        HR_ALL_ORGANIZATION_UNITS - basic org information including name, effective dates, location and business group
        HR_ORG_INFORMATION_TYPES - classifications for rows in HR_ORGANIZATION_INFORMATION (e.g "Legal Accounting Entity)
            This table is pre-seeded and not maintained though any form
        HR_ORG_INFO_TYPES_BY_CLASS - indicates what information types are relevant to different org classes
            This table is preseeded and not maintained through any form
            For example HR_BG and 'Project Burdening Hieararchy' are valid combinations
        HR_ORGANIZATION_INFORMATION - stores the classifications for all organizations and the attributes of the classifications
            The attributes are stored in the descriptive flexfield segments of this table
            This is a primary table for storing organization setups and structures
            The ORG_INFORMATION_CONTEXT column stores the context in this table.
            If it equals 'CLASS' then the row comprised classification data
            For classification data the actual class is in ORG_INFORMATION_1, the enabled flag is in ORG_INFORMATION_2
            The remaining information is in ORG_INFORMATION_3 through ORG_INVFORMATION_20
        HR_LOOKUPS - stores organization classifications (where lookup type = 'ORG_CLASS')
        FND_DESCR_FLEX_COLUMN_USAGES stores the fields applicable to each classification
            The DESCRIPTIVE_FLEXFIELD_NAME is 'Org Developer DF'
            The DESCRIPTIVE_FLEXFIELD_CONTEXT_CODE is 'CLASS'
    These tables are denormalized in Oracle Projects with the table PA_ALL_ORGANIZATIONS

Multi-Org (PER) Notes on Organizations Used by Projects

    see Projects section for information on Organizations Used by Projects
    Note that associations of project organizations to operating units are made within the operating unit
        The table PA_ALL_ORGANIZATIONS maintains these associations
        The same project org can be associated with multiple operating units
        There is one entry line for each association in PA_ALL_PROJECTS
        Transaction activity is stamped with the OPU Org ID and Project Org ID
        This keeps the project org business for each operating unit separate.

Mult-Org Access Control Notes on Setting Context
    R11i Implementation of Multi-Org
        Base data tables exist in the product schema with a naming convention of %_ALL.
        The data in this table is striped by ORG_ID (Operating Unit).
        A view in the APPS schema provides the Multi-Org filtering based on the statement below in the where clause.
        To View Context
            SUBSTRB(USERENV ('CLIENT_INFO'), 1, 10)
        To Set Context to a single organization in 11i
            BEGIN
                dbms_application_info.set_client_info(2);-- 2 is the Org_ID
            END;
        Or you could have used FND_GLOBAL.APPS_INITIALIZE to set your context.
            apps.fnd_global.APPS_INITIALIZE( user_id => <user_id>, resp_id => <responsibility_id>, resp_appl_id => <application_id>);
    R12 Implementation of Mult-Org (MOAC)
        Implements through DB Synonyms with Row Level Security (based on VPD - Virtual Private Database) that replace the old Multi-Org Views
        The Security Policies are not easily viewable using tools like TOAD.
        To set context for the user, responsibility and application use apps_initialize the same as 11i
            apps.fnd_global.APPS_INITIALIZE( user_id => <user_id>, resp_id => <responsibility_id>, resp_appl_id => <application_id>);
        In addition, to set context for a single org in an SQL*Plus Session:
            BEGIN
                execute mo_global.set_policy_context('S',2); -- 'S' means single org, 2 is the Org ID - requires apps
            END;
        Alternatively, to set R12 context to multiple orgs in an R12 context:
            BEGIN
                execute mo_global.set_org_access(NULL,64,'ONT'); -- 64 is the Security Profile, 'ONT' is the application shortname
            END;

Mult-Org Access Control Notes on Creating and Maintaining Security Profiles
    Security Profiles are defined and maintained in the HR Responsibilities
        Navigation: HR Responsibility > Security > Profile (or Global Profile if the definition must cross all Business Group organizations)
    The Security List Maintenance concurrent program must be run each time you add or change Security Profiles.

Mult-Org Access Control Notes on Profile Options
    There are three Profile Options you need to be aware of related to Multi-Org that should be set at the Responsibility Level.
    The R12 profile option MO: Security Profile is always evaluated first.
    The pre-R12 profile option MO: Operating Unit still works in R12.  It is just a secondary priority being evaluated after MO: Security Profile.
    The R12 profile option MO: Default Operating Unit sets the default Operating Unit for transactions when running under a Security Profile.

Mult-Org Access Control Notes on Operating Unit Modes for Concurrent Programs
    Where To Set The "Operating Unit Mode" When Defining A Concurrent Program [ID 847094.1]
    Oracle has implemented a new parameter on the System Administration : Concurrent Programs > Request Settings form to control how to handle Operating Units.
    The Operating Unit Mode parameter does not show up in the System Administor : Define Concurrent Programs form.
    This setting has three values:
        NULL default setting
        Single run only for a specific Operating Unit specified by MO: Operating Unit profile option
            Controls the prompt 'Operating Unit' that appears as a run parameter on all reports
        Multi run for multiple Operating Units based on the MO: Security Profile profile option
    Each program is registered under one or more Operating Units by setting 'Operating Unit Mode'
    For custom programs these needs to be done manually
        Navigation: System Administration > Concurrent > Programs > (Query the program) > Request (Tab) > Request Settings (Section) > Operating Unit Mode (field)
        If the value is set to single, the Operating Unit is the Default Operating Unit for the Security Group under which the program is run
        If the value is multiple, the user can choose which operating unit to use when submitting the program

    Notification Mailer is a tool/service relied upon by Workflow and Alerts to send and receive emails. Concurrent Manager also uses the service to notify users of completed requests, if the request is set up to do so.
    Notification Mailer can be started as a concurrent request by the same name, from within the Oracle Applications
    NM can be shut down on the Windows command line with wfmlr, specifying wfmail.cfg as a target config file (eg. <drive:\orant\bin\wfmlr -f <drive>:\orant\wf\data\wfmail.cfg )
    In operation,WFMAIL queries the Oracle applications instance for pending outbound notifications and dispatches using Unix Sendmail or Windows MAPI (Messaging API)
    Mailer also queries the inbox on the mailserver for responses and sends to the database for processing
    The executable WFMAIL is the main program which processes four stages of a repeating loop: send, inbox routing, response processing and idle
    The send loop builds a message and addressee from a waiting notification the notifications queue (mail_status = ACTIVE) and sends to the mailbox queue via SMTP. If the email address of the recipient is blank WFMAIL sends it to the role members
    The outgoing message contents are built using the WFMAIL.GetShortMessage API call
    For inbox routing, WFMAIL polls the mail account defined in the WFMAIL.CFG file (Account=<parameter>) and scans each mail for a valid notification id (NID) specification. Valid emails are moved to an UNPROCESS file on the server
    In notification processing, the UNPROCESS file is scanned and fed to the Workflow Instance PLSQL for extraction and processing of the responses
    IDLE is normally set for 30 seconds before the loop is repeated
    Notification Mailer used the Workflow Directory Service of Roles, Users and User_Roles to build recipient addresses (WF_USERS, WF_ROLES and WF_USER_ROLES tables)
    Notification Mailer can be configured from Oracle Applications Manager beginning with Version 11.5.7 of the Oracle Applications
    Do -> debug Notification Mailer Status and Setups System Administration/Oracle Applications Manager/Workflow Manager - go/Notification Mailers (check on green or red status button)
    Do -> check mailer is running as a Unix process -> ps -ef | grep wfmail (should show wfmail as a running process)

OA Framework (MDS Schema) Personalization (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on General Functionality
    Personalizations allow declarative changes (through the forms) of the display characteristics
        of the self service (HTML) forms
    OA Framework Personalization uses XML style sheets (XSS)
        to manage visual characteristics and provide a consistant look and feel
    OA Framework supports:
        changing field prompts,
        hiding fields,
        reordering fields,
        restricting data a user can enter,
        adding text, buttons,
        items, links,
        and restricting query results
    OA Framework changes can be performed at multiple levels:
        Function (this is the topmost or global level),
        Industry.
        Localization,
        Site,
        Org,
        Responsibility and
        User (this is the bottom most level)

    Fill in the criteria to locate the OA Framework page and press Go
        Tip: Check 'Personalized' checkbox to only query the pages having a personalization
    Identify the correct page from the results returned

OA Framework (MDS Schema) Personalization (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Style Sheets
    All style sheets are located in the directory /OA_HTML/cabo/styles on the file system
    Style sheets are .xss files - xml versions of .css files
    Properties that can be included in a custom style sheet are listed in the W3C CSS Reference
        http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp.
    The main custom style sheet is custom.css - prior to 11.5.10 CU2
        Prior to 11.5.10 CU2 - this custom.xss was imported into the overall definition css
        The overall look and feel style is defined in blaf.xss
        The overall OA Framework style is defined in oa.xss
    Look and Feel is defined by different style sheets for each of the following
        BLAF (blaf.xss) or Browser Look and Feel is the Oracle Basic Look and Feel
            It defines the Oracle Standard look and feel
            Overrides to BLAF are still performed through custom.xss
                custom.css is also located in /OA_HTML/cabo/styles on the file system
            BLAF cannot be extended
        Base Look and Feel - (no acronym) is the root of all LAF implementations
            Basic Look and Feel can be extended
        CLAF is the Custom Look and Feel - customizable by the user and built on top of BLAF
        MLAF is the Minimal Look and Feel - a simplified lightweight version of BLAF
            MLAF cannot be extended
        SLAF is the Simplified Look and Feel - a sample CLAF built on top of BLAF
            SLAF can be extended
    Changing the style sheets associated with each LAF is done through the LAF interface responsibility
    FND_CLAF_ADMINISTRATOR - provides access to the Customizable Look and Feel (CLAF) interface
        This requires a bounce of the apache to take effect

    Bill-Only Lines
        How To Control the Invoice Date for Non-Shippable Lines? (Doc ID 1089077.1)
    Orders and their behaviour are defined by creating different transaction types (previously order types)
    Shipping is initiated by releasing orders
        This is done manually on the 'Release Sales Orders for Picking' form
        It can also be done by a scheduled concurrent process
        Navigation: <Order Management Superuser, Vision Operations (USA)/Shipping/Release Sales Orders/
    Releasing sales orders creates 'move orders' or 'pickwave move orders'
        It moves materials from inventory to staging areas (a Subinventory transfer)
    Shipping execution includes:
        allocating material to sales orders,
        creating staging move orders
        planning trips/stops/deliveries,
        packing, picking and shipping
        ship confirm
    A stop is a single pickup or delivery location on a trip/route
    A delivery leg is a single origin/destination combination corresponding to a bill of lading and delivery
    Pick release and ship confirm are the two major steps in shipping execution
        All other activities can be grouped or tied to these steps
        Pick release can include:
            releasing orders to pick,
            creating a staging move,
            transacting the move, and
            scheduling/creating trips and deliveries.
        Shipment confirmation or ship confirm includes:
            decreasing inventory,
            printing shipping documents,
            updating stops status to complete and closing the delivery record
    Release rules and Release Sequence Rules drive allocation of materials to orders
        These rules establish rule sets for allocating picked material to open orders
    Document categories allow different document sequences to be assigned to the same document
    Document sets can be attached to pick release and ship confirm to print at the same time
    You can define shipping calendars and assign them to trading partners
        This will guide shipment scheduling

Order Management and Shipping Execution (OM Schema ONT and WSH) Notes on Trading Community Architecture
    CRM modules now utilize the 11i Customer Model which includes: tables, backward compatible views, upgraded customer forms, interfaces and merge processes
    Customer records are now the same for CRM and ERP: iStore and Service customers are the same customers viewed by OM or other ERP applications
    Customers such as businesses and consumers are now 'parties' to a business relationship: subtype data stores the separate attributes
    Parties can also be groups: buying consortiums, households with multiple individuals. A party can also be a relationship between two parties (ie a role), such as employment.
    Party types define what data is collected about them at a lower level. The four party types are: people, organizations, groups and relationships.
    Parties to relationships allow a single method for handling B2B and B2C and mixed model transactions
    Addresses can be linked to multiple parties and recorded only once. Addresses in the trading community architecture are actual entities
    Customer accounts can have multiple parties: customer, agent, broker, guarantor or authorized buyer, etc.
    Parties can become members of categories and classes: categories are classification schemes such as industry, size, etc. Classes and sub-classes within each category allow for grouping along similar attribute values
    Associated entities with parties are: Locations (geolocations/addresses), Party Sites (link between party and location), Party Site Use (activity at the Party Site) and Party Relationship (spouse of, parent of, employee of)
    Once defined, a Relationship can be a party as well (eg Fred as spouse of Mary, party type relationship)
    A relationship party can have all the entity associations of any other type of party: party site, contact point, customer accounts
    Contacts are parties that serve as contacts for other parties, mostly as contacts within an organization
    Contact Points are methods of making the contact, as well as the contact address. These are URL's, phone numbers
    Customer accounts represent business relationships and attributes of the account are associated with it to track terms and conditions and activities.
    Each account has only one owner
        Any number of other parties can be associated with the account in different roles
    Customer account sites are party sites that are used for business purposes with an account.
        These can be ship-to, bill-to, and other purposes
    Customer account contacts are contacts related to accounts
        This is instead of being related to a business or other party in the absence of an account
    Customer agreements are a longer term and more stable business relationship than an account.
        Agreement terms can be set in a customer agreement and attached to an order
            They specify price list, billing and payment terms, invoicing rules and accounting/revenue recognition rules
    Agreements are a way of offering preferential terms to customers such as discounts, while reducing the errors of implementing those terms

Order Management and Shipping Execution (OM Schema ONT and WSH) Notes on Processing Constraints:
    Processing constraints are rules to limit what a responsibility can do to a sales order.
        They replace security rules in 11i
    Multiple processing constraints can be grouped into a single rule
        (AND and OR conditions on multiple constraints)
    Processing constraints can utilize:
        workflow activity status,
        values of data attributes and
        custom PL/SQL code to determine an outcome
    Custom error messages can be written to display to a user
        They can show if a processing constraint evaluates to TRUE and prevents a user action

    Fulfillment Sets ensure all order lines are billed together and non-ship lines are billed when all shipped lines are fulfilled

Order Management and Shipping Execution (OM Schema ONT and WSH) Notes on Seeded Workflows:
    Order management switches from Order Cycles to Workflow with version 11i
        Order Cycles comprised a sequence of steps or actions
            Actions are predefined and seeded in Order Management
            They are joined in a sequence to define a specific order flow
            Each action has a choice of outcomes - choose one outcome in a process
        Actions that are predefined in Order Management to include in a process are:
            Enter - the order is entered
            Demand Interface - demand created from order
            Manufacturing Release - creates work order in WIP
            Purchase Release - creates purchase requistion lines
            Pick Release - creates picking lines
            Backorder Release - creates picking lines from backorder
            Ship Confirm - confirms shipments occured on an order
            Inventory Interface - updates items on hand in inventory
            RMA Interface - updates items on hand
            Receivables Interface - creates lines for invoices in AR
            Complete Line - closes/completes a line on the order
            Complete Order - closes/completes an order
            Cancel Order - cancels a customer order
            Cancel Line - cancels a line on a customer order
        Order Level Transaction Types replace version 11 Order Types
            Flows are tied to Order Types to drive the Order Entry Process
            Exercise: View Transaction Types and Associated workflows ->
                <Order Managment>/Setup/Transaction Types
    Workflow manages the state of all activities in each order
        It maintains a history of completed activities and executes error processes
    Each line of an order can have a different workflow
        So returns and shipments can be processed in the same order
    Workflow processes can have an unlimited number of activites,
        The older version Order Cycles were limited to 30 activities
    11i upgrade scripts move Order Cycles to Workflows
        The upgraded workflows are not efficient and should not be used on new orders

Patches and Patching (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    See Metalink Note 174436.1 for a review of patch types and FAQ's
    Patch FAQ's Note 459156.1
    See Metalink Note 181665.1 for Rel11i ADPatch Basics
    The primary types of patches are:
        stand alone (one off) patch,
            high priority one-offs are issued to all customers as urgent fixes
            are used to solve specific issues by providing a single fix or enhancement
            only released if needed immediately, otherwise rolled into a rollup or mini-pack
        Release Update Pack (RUP) patch
            bundles together patches that apply to a single product and functional area at a single release level
            Used by Oracle On Demand to keep customers current on their release patch levels
        mini-pack (aka patchset, like 11i.INV.E)
            An aggregate of patches at the product level
            Named in alphabetical sequence within Apps version (e.g. 11i.INV.E, 11i.INV.F, 11i.INV.G)
            Minipacks are cumulative
            The term Minipack is often used interchangeably with 'Patchset'
        family pack (like 11i_FIN_PF.C)
            a consolidation of multiple patches at the product family level to a point in time.
                The include an FP suffix in the name, like 11i_FIN_PF.C.
            always designate a family of applications like FIN or HR or MF
            Family Consolidated Upgrade (or Update) Patch (FCUP)
                a required set of patches that must be applied before an upgrade
                    in order for the upgrade scripts to run
        maintenance pack (like 11.5.10 and 11.5.9)
            consolidation of family packs for the entire eBusiness Suite
                (this terminology started with Release 11i). Maintenance packs are cumulative.
            undergoe a distinct QA review and increments the product level version number (eg 11.5.9, 11.5.10)
            includes the rapid install alternative to install the complete application suite
                i.e. you can choose 11.5.10 Rapid Install or 11.5.10 Maintenance Pack
            can be downloaded from metalink or obtained through the Oracle store.
                on metalink, go to the Patches and Updates tab and choose the eDelivery link, or
                go directly to http://edelivery.oracle.com/
        Recommended Patch Collections (RPCs)
    A minor release is a release with two numbers in the software release code
        (eg 10.7, 11.0, 11.5 etc) these are not considered patches.
    The latest versions of packs are listed on metalink under the patches area
        through "Quick links to the latest patchsets....../Latest Application Minipacks..."
    Patches have different purposes also:
        diagnostic: Diagnostic patches are used to gather additional information when a problem has occured
        interoperability: Allows Oracle Applications to work with newer versions of the technology stack
        translated: publishes a patch in a non-English language.
        Otherwise known as NLS patches (National Language Support)
        merged translation: a translation patch provided in real time
            used when there is no translator available to generate a translation patch - a quick fix
        new feature:  provides a new feature or function. A standard patch applied with standard patching utilities
        consolidated update: includes a number of post release patches that should be applied after a new release patch is installed.
        family consolidated update (FCUP): includes consolidated patches for a family of products rather than a single product
        documentation - updates online help
    Pack-style patch sets (mini, family and maintenance) should be applied frequently
        to avoid complexities with patching and prerequisites for needed patching, and
        to keep up with functionality
    Minipacks and a family packs should be used to fix problems
        if it is not possible to wait until a maintenance pack release.
    Patch lists for applied patches are stored on the Unix file system (up to AD Minipack E)
        in /d131/oracle/ofd3appl/admin/ofd3, and in the database after that time.
        The patch history search functions of Oracle Applications Manager (OAM) provides tools to search patch history
        OAM provides patch search and a list of bugs fixed by each patch
    Patches are seven digit numbers such as 3779715 which are searchable on metalink and within the application tables
    Metalink has full patch information for all patches and associated bug fixes
        Patch driver files (.drv files) are files used by the autopatch utility
            They direct the installation of a patch and are named [cdgu]<patchnumber>.drv
        c prefix driver files are copy driver files and create files in the operating system file system structure such as java, c and libraries
        d prefix driver files are database driver files that run plsql scripts to create or modify database objects
        g prefix driver files create forms and reports on the applications tier server
        u prefix driver files are unified drivers which combine the actions of the other three driver types
            They have intelligence to know which actions to perform
    Tables where patch history are stored include the APPLSYS.AD_PATCHES_APPLIED
        Also look for other tables matching %AD%PATCH% in the data dictionary
    Patches are shipped as a zip file (they were tar files until release 11i)
        when they are unzipped they create a directory using the patch number
        The directory made for each patch contains the readme file, the driver files (c, d and g files)
    E-Delivery in Oracle Metalink provides downloading of Oracle Applications
        The link is available on the Patches and Updates tab under the Updates subheading
        Or, go directly to the site at http://edelivery.oracle.com
    In order to install a patch it is important to first shut down the concurrent managers
    Interactive patch application can be started with the 'adpatch' command at the command line.
        The adpatch utility will ask for the name of the driver file to execute the patch
        Run adpatch in test mode to see the impact on existing objects without actually applying the patch. Use "addpatch apply=no" to run this process
    Multiple patches can be merged first, before they are applied.
        This is done with the "admrgpch" command at the operating system level.
    Exercise: Search applied patches: System Administration/Oracle Application Manager/Navigate
        to "Search Patches"/ and enter a date range or patch number to search.

Patches and Patching (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Key Tables
    AD_APPL_TOPS
    AD_APPLIED_PATCHES The main table when we are talking about patches that applied in Oracle Apps.
        This table holds information about the "distinct" and "requested" Oracle Applications patches that have been applied.
        It does not include individual patches contained in rollup patches - look in AD_BUGS for those
        It does not include pre-requisite patches listed in ad_bugs
        If 2 patches happen to have the same name but are different in content (e.g. "merged" patches), then they are considered distinct and this table will therefore hold 2 records (eTRM).
        I also found that if the applications tier node is separate from the concurrent manager node, and the patch applied on both nodes, this table will hold 2 records, one for each node.
    AD_INSTALL_PROCESSES
    AD_PATCH_DRIVERS - This table holds information about all patch drivers included in specific patch.
        For example if patch contain only one unified driver like u[patch_name].drv then ad_patch_drivers will hold 1 record.
        On the other hand, if patch contain more than 1 driver, for example d[patch_name].drv and c[patch_name].drv, this table will hold 2 records.
    AD_PATCH_RUNS - holds information about each execution of adpatch for a specific patch driver.
        In case a patch contains more than one driver, this table will hold a record for each driver.
        This table also holds one record for each node the patch driver has been applied on (column APPL_TOP_ID).
    AD_PATCH_RUN_BUGS - holds information about all the bugs fixed as a part of specific run of adpatch.
    AD_SESSIONS
    AD_BUGS - this table holds information about all bug fixes that have been applied.
        Since all patches are bugs, it includes information on all bugs and all patches applied to the instance
        It includes all pre-requisite patches that are applied as part of applying a requested patch

Patches and Patching (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Form Patches
    If you want to look at the patch form version before it is applied,
        you can download the patch to your pc and unzip and then ftp it to the application server
        to run the following process.
            Go to the application server and the folder where you ftp'ed the patch files.
            Then run 'adident Header FNDATREP.fmx' (or any other form file in the patch).
            The 'adident' utility is an 'AD Identification' program.
        To get the current form version, go to the application server and go under $FND_TOP/forms/US,
        (this also works after the patch is applied of course).
        Then run 'adident Header FNDATREP.fmx'. The response will something like ...
            FNDATREP.fmx:
            $Header APPSTAND.fmb 115.33 2002/04/04 11:13:40 pkm ship
            $Header FNDATREP.fmb 115.8 2004/07/29 15:38  tshort ship
        You can also run the patch with apply = 'N'
            it will tell you which files will be replaced and which ones have version issues.
    Then the next best bet is to download the patch to your pc,
        then unzip it and open the *.fmb with wordpad.
        It will look really ugly, but just search for '$Header' without the ticks.
        It will look like this below of with just a bunch of
        &#0; #0;#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;&#0;i
            $Header: APXVDDUP.fmb 110.18 2001/01/19 10:53:26 pkm ship
    Alternatively, to fetch a form version from the database
        query apps.ad_files and apps.ad_file_versions for files matching the form name

    The flag 'Maximize Credits' in the Processing Tab of a Payment Processing Request should be selected to avoid not having any invoices selected
        If this flag is not set and outstanding credits exceed outstanding debit invoices, no debit invoices will be chosen
        Maximize credits (set) results in a zero payment when the total credits exceed total invoices
            All credits are used, up to the value of the invoices, and the unused credits are available for future payment
        Maximize credits (not set) result in no invoices being selected if the credits exceed the invoices

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on System Features Overview in R12
    Payments is a central engine to disburse and capture payments
        For electronic payment it connects modules such as AP and AR with financial institutions and credit card processors
        It does not include payroll processing which remains in the payroll application
        It also performs bank transfers for Cash Management
    All payment types previously covered in AR, AP, iPayments and Global Financials are integrated into Payments
    Payment types include:
        AR: Credit Card, Direct Debit, Bills Receivable Remittances
            All funds capture processing is managed from AR responsibilities, via Funds Capture Manager
        AP: Checks (Printed), Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), Customer Refunds
            All funds disbursement processing is managed from AP resonsibilities, via Payment Manager
        CE: Funds Transfer
    It includes a seeded library of eText payment formats
        eText is an XML Publisher Template type which handles fixed length record types efficiently
        Supported formats include: Swift MT 103, ANSI X12 820, EDIFACT PAYMUL, and NACHA (CTX, CCD, CCDP and PPD)
    The Payments Process includes: Invoice Selection (i.e. scheduled payments create proposed payments), Payments Build (create actual payments), File Creation (in XML), Formatting (via eText) into a Payment Instruction and Transmission
        Invoice selection can be defined without regard to payment method for a payment run
            Invoices are selected by an AP or AR process and made eligible for payments (source system selection process using payment method, currency and operating unit)
                This is initiated from the Payment Processing Request
        Payments are also created via Payment Processing Requests (multiple can apply to a single list of eligible invoices)
            This is the Payments Build Program - also initiated/performed by the Payment Processing Request
        Payments are grouped and a payment instruction (payment file) is created for each group of payments (by the Payment Instruction Creation Program)
            One payment instruction can be build from the payments generated by multiple payment processing requests also.
            Payment Instructions can be built across organizations where each organization created payments in the prior step
        Transmission of the payment instructions is performed to generate a file to a bank, third party or to a check printer
    The entire process can be centralized or decentralized to match the disbursements organization
    A new 'Payments Manager Dashboard' provides an overview of all payment activity and allows actions to be taken and processes to be submitted
        Navigation: Payments Responsibility > Payments > Entry > Payments Manager
    A new 'Funds Disbursement Process (FDP) Dashboard' provides capabilities to generate payments from proposed payments across multiple operating units
        This dashboard does not provide the capability to generate the initial proposed payments
        It is limited to submitting concurrent processes to create payment instructions and monitoring their progress
    The 'Payments Workbench'remains in AP to process single payments, manual payments, record refunds against credit memo's and generate electronic quick payments
        Navigation: Payments Responsibility > Payments > Entry > Payments
    You can also pay an invoice directly from the Invoice Workbench in Payables
        This initiates a manual payment or a quick payment only, and Oracle defaults most of the payment information automatically

Payments (IBY Schema) Benefits
    Payments can be run in a Payment Factory mode where the central organization issues a single combined payment instruction to the bank
        This significantly reduces the cost of bank transactions by generating a combined payment file across multiple operating units
    Shared Service Center operations is a benefit because payment processing can be centralized into a single service group
        This can include both payment scheduling and generation of payments in addition to generating a singe centralized payment instruction

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Entity Definitions
    Document - an invoice or credit memo or debit memo
    Bill of Exchange (11i) or Bill Receivable (R12) - a promisory note to pay on a given date and for a given amount (can be negotiated or sold at a discount)
        Used in place of general trade credit so it can be resold - commits the payee to a specific amount and date to pay/remit
    Payment Instruction: a single file of payments that are printed as checks or transmitted to a financial institution or third party for processing
        A single Payment Instruction can be build from the results of multiple payment process request
    Templates - saved configurations of selection critieria, payment attributes and processing rules that can be reused in multiple payment runs
        Templates can be used in scheduled payment runs also
    Payment Methods
        Payment Method is a payment attribute on the payment document (i.e. invoice)
        It indicates the medium by which payment is made
        Payment Method definitions include defaulting rules used to assign payment method to a document
        Examples are: Checks, Outsourced Checks, Wires, EFT (via ACH in the US, BACS in the UK)
        Payment methods are seeded but additional methods can be user defined
        Selection of payment method on a source document can be restricted to eliminate errors
        In Payables, the default payment method is assigned to the supplier site and can be over-ridden
            This supplier site default is allowed or disallowed in Oracle Payments by Disbursement System Option - Default Payment Method
        Defaulting Rules are assigned to Payment Methods and can be used to default payment methods onto documents in Payments processing
            Navigation: Oracle Payments Setup > Funds Disbursement Setup > Payment Methods > Payment Defaulting Rules
            If the Payments Disbursement System Option 'Default Payment Method' is set to only use defaulting rules, these rules override the defaulting on the source document
        Payment Methods are Defined in Payment setup and can include anticipated float time, and exclusion from defaulting onto payment documents
    Payment Processing Profile
        Specifies payment handling of a payment document including payment generation and payment instruction generation
        General Attributes - include:
            Active Status and End Date,
            Processing Type (printed or electronic)
            Channel (Payments or Gateway)
            When Payment is Marked Complete (e.g. when formatted)
            Manual Completion Status Restrictions (Yes or No)
            Payment Completion Point (e.g. When Payment if Formatted)
                This can be anywhere from when the payment instruction is formatted to where the instruction file is transmitted to the bank
        Usage Rules - limit where a Payment Process Profile can be used
            These rules include restrictions for: Payment Methods, First Parties, Internal Bank Accounts and Currencies
            Payment Creation Options including how scheduled payments are grouped into proposed payments
            Payment Instruction Creation Options including how proposed payments are grouped into actual payments, how payments are sorted, and additional bank instruction text
        Payment System
            For positive pay and electronic payment processing (determined by the Processing Type header attribute = 'Electronic')
                Payment Process Profiles are mapped to Payment Systems, Payment System Accounts, and Transmission Configurations.
        The Relationship between Payment Process Profiles and Payment Methods is many to many
            One Payment Process Profile can be assigned to many Payment Methods (by putting the same Payment Process Profile on many Payment Processing Requests, each with different Payment Method selection)
                In this case you can also leave the Payment Process Profile off the Payment Processing Request and assign it manually when proposed payments are generated
            One Payment Method can be assigned to many Payment Process Profiles (by putting a different Payment Process Profile on different Payment Processing Requests with the same Payment Method selection)
                In this case you will have other criteria in the Payment Processing Requests that differentiate the selected invoices
                You can also manually assign different Payment Process Profiles to proposed payments via the manual assignment option by leaving the Payment Process Profile off the Payment Processing Request
        Payment Instruction Format
            The name of the payment format
            The location where the electonic formatted file is place and how it is named
    Payment Instruction
        A single file of payments with header information, payment records and summary payment amounts
            The payment instruction can be printed (as checks) or physically transmitted to the bank to execute payment
    Transmission Protocols
        These are seeded by Oracle and determine which attributes are needed when a Transmission Configuration is created
    Transmission Configuration
        A Transmission Configuration is a delivery destination for an electronic file
        The Transmission Protocol (choose from seeded values) is defined first and this determines the attributes needed to define the configuration
        A Transmission Configuration together with a Payment System are attached to a Payment Process Profile
    Payment Systems
        A Payment System defines the allowable Payment Formats, allowable Transmission Protocols, base URL Servlet address and special transmission codes required
        It also defines the type (Gateway or Processor) and allowable transactions (credit card, account transfer, debit card)
        Together with a Transmission Protocol it is used on a Payment Process Profile to define a destination
    Disbursement System Options
        Navigation: Oracle Payments Setup > Funds Disbursement Setup > Disbursement System Options
            Allows setting two options at the Business Group and Operating Unit Level
                Default Payment Method - use defaulting rules or use method on payee, then use defaulting rules if blank on payee
                Allow Payee Bank Account Override on Proposed Payments - makes the payee bank account editable on proposed payments

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture and Disbursement Responsibilities
    Funds Capture Setup Administrator
        Provides access to the Funds Capture Setup page (for funds capture and shared setups)
    Funds Capture Process Manager
        Provides access to the Funds Capture Process Dashboard
    Funds Disbursement Setup Administrator
        Provides access to the Funds Disbursement Setup page (for funds disbursement and shared setups)
    Funds Disbursement Process Manager
        Provides access to the Funds Disbursement Process (FDP) Dashboard

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture Payment Methods
    The payment method is the medium or vehicle used by the payer to remit payment
        Includes: checks, electronic bank account transfers, credit cards, PINless Debit Cards, Bills Receivable Remittances, Outsourced Checks
            The payment method for PINless Debit and Credit cards is seeded.
    A payment method has an associated 'float' time and can have validations applied, just as Payment Formats have validations applied

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture Payment Formats
    Defines the Payment Type, Data Extract,  XML Publisher Template and Validations for the layout
    Type - is one of several seeded values that limit the data extract that can be chosen
        For Example: Disbursement Payment Instruction is a 'Type'
        The Type limits the choices of pre-defined data extract choices that can be made in defining the format
    Data Extract - a predefined Oracle program that extracts the data according to a specific schema
        e.g. IBY_FD_PAYMENT_INSTRUCTION 1
    XML Publisher Template - defines the layout applied to the file to format the fixed record output
    Validations can be selected from seeded definitions or from custom (user-defined) definitions
        In general, validations can be assigned to a payment formats and to Disbursement Payment Methods
        Multiple validations can be attached to a single format

    You can extract the underlying XML to analyze eText templates using the 'Extract Entity' option in a Payment Format
        Reference: MOS Note 457400.1 Extract Identity
        Create a new Payment Processing Format in Funds Disbursement Setup Administrator Responsibility
        Choose Type as Disbursement Payment Instruction
        Click Create and define a name and code for the new Format
        Select the data extract to match the data extract used by the eText template
            e.g. Oracle Payments Funds Disbursement Payment Instruction Extract, Version 1 (used for ACH and check payments)
        Select the XML Publisher Template as 'Extract Identity' and apply the changes - no other changes are needed
        Attach the new format to a Payment Process Profile (you can define a new profile if needed)
        Associate the new format to the bank that it will be used to generate payments
            Navigation: Payables Manager > Setup > Payments > Bank Accounts > (Query the Bank and Select the Account) > Manage Payment Documents
            Add the format to the bank account so it is a valid payment format for the account
        Now run a payment process (enter, validate and confirm an invoice in AP first, etc) and generate the XML output

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Validations
    Reference: R12: Oracle Payments Grouping and Validations Explained [ID 1384297.1]
    Validations can be assigned to Payment Formats and to Disbursement Payment Methods - multiple validations can be assigned to each
        The assignment of seeded validations (and the creation of user-defined validations) is done in the entity definition form
            It cannot be done in the Validations viewing form
    There are seeded validations and user-defined validations
        Seeded Validations are viewable via Navigation: Payment Administrator > Payment Setup > Shared Setup > Validations
            Seeded validations can be country specific to meet the requirements of different countries, or generic
            User defined validations cannot be viewed or defined via this navigation
            User defined validations can only be viewed and defined from the Format or Method to which they are attached
            The Validation Point is the point at which the validation is applied - see 'Validation Points'
            You can see which Payment Formats and Disbursement Payment Methods a validation is assigned in the 'Assigned Entity' tab of the Validation Definition
            Validations take parameters and these parameters are viewable in the validation definition in the 'Parameters' tab alongside the 'Assigned Entity' tab
            Assignments can be removed from Payment Methods and Payment Formats unless the entity is seeded in which case they cannot be modified
        User Defined Validations
            User Defined Validations are defined in the same form as the entity is being defined that requires validations
                They cannot be defined or viewed in the standard viewing page for seeded validations
                For example a user defined validation for a Payment Format is created in the Payment Format Definition page
            User Defined Validations have implicitly defined Validation Points (based on the name of the field being validated) - see below
                The Validation Point determines where the validation is applied (document, proposed payment, payment, instruction)
            A User Defined validation comprises:
                Field Name - the name of the field being validated - this also implicitly determines the validation point
                Validtion Name - the condition name such as 'greater that' or 'less than'
                Country - if the validation is for a specific country
                Payment Method - if the validation is specific to a payment method also
     Actions to Take When Documents, Payments and Instructions Fail Validations
         Most commonly the action to take is to exclude the document from processing (i.e. remove the document or payment from the Payment Process Request)
             Secondarily action can be to correct the source problem in the such as setup or third party payeed data, then resubmit the process
        Validation Points apply to Seeded and User Defined Validations
            The Validation Point determines where the validation is applied (document, proposed payment, payment, instruction)
            For seeded validations the validation point is pre-set as one of: Document, Payment, Payment Instruction, Settlement or Settlement Batch
            For user defined validations, the validation point is decided by the Field Name you choose to validate
                For example if you choose the field name 'Document Amount' the validation is applied to a document
                If you choose the field name 'Payment Instruction Total Amount' the validation is applied to the Payment Instruction
            Validations can have one of four validation points:
                Document level in the source product (e.g. Invoice in payables) - these validations must be assigned to the Payment Method
                Document level in Payments (e.g. Invoice as a Proposed Payment) - these validations must be assigned to the Payment Format
                    They must also be Document Level validations (i.e. the Validation field must be a Document field)
                Payment level in Payments (e.g. Payment in Actual Payments) - these validations must be set on Payment fields
                Payment Instruction level in Payments - these validations must be set on Payment Instruction fields

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture Process Profiles
    Communication profile with payment system
        Payer Verification
        Notification rules
        Acknowledgement rules
        Batch building rules
    The profile is invoked from routing rules in  payee (internal organization) setup
    Similar to Payment Process Profile for AP
    Grouping
        Reference: R12: Oracle Payments Grouping and Validations Explained [ID 1384297.1]
        Grouping criteria can be selected to determine
            How documents/proposed payments are grouped into payments and
            How payments are grouped into instructions
            These grouping criteria can be used to create separate payments or separate instructions where otherwise a single combined payment or instruction would be created
        All Grouping of proposed payments and payments are defined in the Payment Process Profile and include:
            Grouping selected documents (invoices and memos) into Proposed Payments (via Payment Process Request)
                This is done on the Payments Creation tab of a Payment Process Profile Definition
            Grouping payments into Payment Instructions
                This is done on the Payment Instruction Creation tab of a Payment Process Profile Definition
        Grouping of Documents into Payments (i.e. Document Grouping)
            This is done by IBY_PAYGROUP_PUB which groups validated documents into proposed payments
            Exception - if the payment process request selects credit memos, AP pregroups these document and grouping is not done by Payments
                When a PPR contains memos, Payables will pre-group the "Documents Payable" (the selected invoices and memos)
                    by stamping them with a payment grouping number (IBY_DOCS_PAYABLE_ALL.PAYMENT_GROUPING_NUMBER).
                When the payments Build Payments program detects that the Documents Payable are pre-grouped by Payables,
                it will ignore all the user-defined grouping rules defined in the Payment Process Profile, and apply only the pre-defined grouping rules.
        Grouping of Payments into Payment Instructions
            This is done by IBY_PAYINSTR_PUB which groups payments into payment instructions
Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture Payment Systems
    Payment System are electronic destinations where payment files are sent
    Payment Systems define:
        The processing model (processor or gateway)
        The destination bank processor or gateway
        The communication character set
        The transmission servlet (destination) URL and status
        The supported capabilities: credit, debit, account transfer
        The payment formats supported
        The transmission protocols supported
        The attributes of the transmission including source and destination, protocol and account/passwords (transmission configuration)
        Special codes required in the file and their datatypes
        Bank Account Lead Days for Capture Processing (days delay in executing the capture)

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Wallets:
    Wallets must be defined to hold encryption certificates
        A Wallet is a file which stores a system key
    The Wallet location and password are stored in locations identified by FND profile options
        FND_DB_WALLET_DIR (Database Wallet Directory)
            e.g. /opt/oracle/product/applzmgt/11.2.0.3/appsutil/wallet
    It uses Oracle Wallet Manager to manage the contents of the wallet file
    The wallet performs two functions:
        HTTP client Authentication when connecting to an external destination servlet
        It holds the private key of the entity authorized to send transactions - allowing the sending entity to encrypt the data
    A wallet setup page is used to:
        Specify the location of the wallet file
        Define the password of the wallet file
        Specify whether to generate the system key yourself or let the system do it
    To create a wallet file
        Run owm on the Unix level on the middle tier server
        Import the private encryption key used for client authentication at the destination
        Initialize the system security key via Payments Setup > System Security Options
            This identifies the location of the wallet file to Oracle
            It allows specifying the wallet password that will be used to encrypt the contents
            It generates a private encryption key (or allows you to load a predefined key) and stores it in the wallet
    Once the wallet is defined it can be activated for payment instrument
        Navigation: Payments Setup > System Security Options > Payment Instruments (region)

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture Payment System Accounts
    One payment system has one or more accounts
    You define the account by giving it a name in Payment System Definition
    You can define one or more accounts for a single payment system

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture Payees
    Payees (Internal Organizations) are Created in Payments Module
    Payees are business units and legal entities and are defined to include:
        Organizations for which they process receipts
        Payment Instruction Types
        Payment System Accounts and Funds Capture Process Profiles that can be used
        Risk formulas
        Routing rules

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture Bank Account Transfers
    Includes Business to Consumer and Business to Business models
    Transfers funds from customer bank account to payee bank account
    Performs Funds Validations in real time for fraud alerts and account validity
    Funds Capture bank account transfers are always processed offline in batches

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture Processor vs Gateway Payment Processor Models
    Processors operate directly with the banks
    Gateways are third parties that operate indirectly (i.e. a payment gateway)
        Gateways are for low volume transactions and offer simplicity and lower authentication overhead
            All activity with gateways is online and realtime
        Direct processors are for high volume transactions and require rigorous authentication
            Processor activity is real-time for authentication and batch/offline for transactions

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Funds Capture Routing Rules
    Funds Capture Routing Rules apply to receivables and not payables
        For payables the internal bank account is determined from the payment process profile
        For receivables the Routing Rules dynamically attach the internal bank account to the processing profile
    Each payee/internal organization can have its own routing rules for funds capture
    Routing rules derive and associate: Payment System Account and Funds Capture Process Profile
    Routing rules comprise:
        Basic rule information - rule name and payment method
        Destination - the payment system and method of sending (payment system account and funds capture process profile)
        Conditions - under which the routing rule is applicable (amount, currency, bank routing number etc)
    How Routing rules work:
        The routing engine retrieves routing rules based on the payee (internal) organization and payment method in the payment request
        The routing rule with the highest priority is evaluated first for matching transaction values and conditions
            If no match, the next routing rule is evaluated
            If no routing rules match, the transaction is routed to the default Payment System
                This is the default Payment System Account and Funds Capture Process Profile

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Payment Processing Requests
    A payment processing request is an actual submission for a single organization and payment method to disburse or capture funds
        It starts by selecting eligible invoices for payment (i.e. selecting scheduled payments)
        It includes choices on how to respond to validation failures (e.g. reject only payments with errors)
        Invoices that cannot be paid due to payment validation failures are put on hold and the holds are viewable in the invoice inquiry form

Payments (IBY Schema) Notes on Payment Processing Business Flow
    Main Steps
        Document Selection (AP programs/code), aka 'AutoSelect'
            Selects invoice and memo documents
        (Build and) Confirm Payments (IBY programs/code)
            Assigns bank account
            Assigns payment process profile
            Performs validations
            Creates proposed payments
            Updates proposed payments if manual changes are made
        Format Payments (IBY programs/code) - the Payment Instructions Build process
            Creates and formats payment instructions (including files)
            Transmits EFT files
        Confirm Payments (AP Programs/code)
            Prints checks
            Records completed payments
            Updates invoices as paid
            Updates the payment history file
    Define a Payment Processing Request (in Payment Manager)
        Navigation: Payables Responsibility > Payments > Entry > Payments Manager (displays the Payments Manager 'Dashboard')
        Choose the Payment Processing Request tab, then click 'Submit Single Request'
        Enter a name for the Payment Processing Request
        Choose a template to default most of the settings on the Payment Processing Request, otherwise enter the values manually
            You can also choose a template then modify the values that are defaulted
        On the 'Scheduled Payments Selection Criteria' tab
            Enter Required fields: Payment Process Request Name, and Pay Through date, Payment Date (Payments tab), Payment Exchange Rate Type (Payments tab)
                The Pay Through Date applies to the Invoice Discount Date or Invoice Due Date (you have a separate option to exclude items based on Discount Date)
            Specify any optional selection criteria: Pay From Date, Payment Priorities, Supplier Type, Payee, Payment Method, Invoice Batch, Invoice Exchange Rate Type
                Since payment method is optional, you can leave it open to pay invoices with different payment methods in the same payment processing request
        On the Payment Attributes tab
            Optionally specify the Payment Process Profile, Bank Disbursement Account and Payment Document (can be done later during payment build)
        On the Process tab
            Choose to pause processing after Scheduled Payment Selection and after Proposed Payment Creation (Process tab)
            Choose 'Maximize Credits' to create a payment that draws down as much available credit memo value as possible
                Warning: if you don't choose this option and credits exceed invoice values, no invoices will be selected because no payments should be made
                If you choose this option, credits will be included in the payment build process to the extent they do not exceed invoice values
        On the Validations Failure Results Tab
            Choose how to handle validation failures
        On the Additional Information Tab
            Specify additional information if the DFF for Payments is defined
    Submit the Payment Process Request (by clicking 'Submit' from Payment Manager) to select invoices and run payment processes
        Concurrent Process 'Select Scheduled Payments' runs (AP_AUTOSELECT_PGK aka AutoSelect) - this is an AP process
            The status of the Payment Process Request is set to 'Selecting Invoices'
        A record is inserted into AP_INV_SELECTION_CRITERIA_ALL with a checkrun_name which is the same as the payment process request name.
            A Payment Process Profile and Internal Bank Account (to build payments) are not required and can be added later
        Invoices are selected based on Due Date, Discount Date, Paygroup and other criteria in the Process Payment Request
        Selected invoices are inserted into AP_SELECTED_INVOICES_ALL
        Unselected invoices are inserted into AP_UNSELECTED_INVOICES_ALL
        AP_PAYMENT_SCHEDULES_ALL.CHECK_RUN_ID is stamped on each AP_PAYMENT_SCHEDULES_ALL record for the selected documents
        Invoices are locked to prevent being selected by another payment process request
        It generates the 'Scheduled Payment Selection Report' (viewable via SRS)
        If no invoices meet the selection criteria (so no records in AP_PAYMENT_SCHEDULES_ALL are tagged) the Payment Process Request is cancelled
            The status of the PPR is set to 'Cancelled - No Invoices Selected'
        Else If 'Pause after Scheduled Payment Selection' has been chosen in the Payment Process Request
            The Payment Process Request ends in status 'Invoices Pending Review' and the IBYBUILD process ('Build Payments') is not automatically started
            Available actions are 'Cancel' and 'Modify/Proceed'
            Choose 'Start Action' for the 'Modify/Proceed' Action (from Payment Manager) to review selected invoices (on the 'Selected Scheduled Payments' page)
                Add or remove selected Invoices and modify the discounts and payment amounts
                Choose 'View Unselected' (from 'Selected Scheduled Payments' page) to review unselected invoices (on the 'Unselected Scheduled Payments' page)
            Choose 'Add Scheduled Payments' (from Payment Manager) to enter criteria to search and select additional scheduled payments
                This can include adding invoices that were excluded due to larger credit notes offsetting their value
            Make changes such as adding scheduled payments (search is by supplier) or removing them
            Then submit the changes by clicking 'Submit' from the 'Select Scheduled Payments' Region of the Scheduled Payments Review page
                This will submit the process to build proposed payments directly
            You can also Review Cash Requirements (from Payment Manager)
        Else If the Pause After Scheduled Payment Selection was not chosen, the Build program (IBYBUILD 'Build Payments') is submitted automatically to create proposed payments.
        However if documents fail validations assigned to the Payment Method and the validations apply at the document level
            The user can navigate to the Resolve Document Validation Errors page to review the validation errors and
                Dismiss individual documents payable from the payment process, if necessary, and
                Restart the Build Payments process when the errors have been resolved.
    Select action 'Initiate Payment Creation' and click 'Submit' to start the proposed payments creation process (from Payment Manager - IBYBUILD 'Build Payments')
            This process may follow on directly from the 'Submit' process above which triggered 'Calculating Special Amounts'
            This is an AP process that builds proposed payments
            This starts the proposed payment build process directly
                If the option to Calulate Special Amounts and Witholding Taxes is chosen in the Payment Process Request
                This starts the 'Apply Changes, Recalculate Amounts and Submit Request (Recalculate Payment Process Request)' process
                It calculates special amounts such as interest and taxes immediately prior to generating proposed payments
                    The status of the Payment Processing Request is set to 'Calculating Special Amounts'
                    This step is optional and driven by the 'Calculate Withholding Tax and Interest During the Scheduled Payment Selection' flag on the Payment Process Request
            The status of the Payment Process Request is set to 'Assembling Payments' and changes to 'Selected' and then 'Building'
            This program is called by AP and calls the package IBY_DISBURSE_SUBMIT_PUB_PKG
            There is no output report for this program
            It groups Scheduled Payments into proposed payments
        If the IBYBUILD ends immediately in status 'Information Required - Pending Action' then errors were found (i.e. information required to create the payments is missing)
            For example it cannot find a default internal bank and Payment Process Profile
            The display status of the Payment Processing Request is 'Information Required - Pending Action'
            Click on 'Start Action' button to review these issues (on the 'Complete Document Assignments' page)
                This opens the 'Complete Document Assignments' page to assign a bank account and Payment Process Profile
                You can assign a different payment process profile and bank account to each payment
            The user should complete the missing Assignment information and rerun the Payment Process to continue.
                This is done by choosing the action 'Run Payments Process' in the 'Complete Document Assignments' window
                Once you restart the payment process, the status returns to 'Assembling Payments'
                You can also terminate the Payment Process Request here.
            Alternatively there are payment level validations that failed
                The user can go to the Resolve Payment Validation Errors page to review the validation errors
                Actions allowed include removing documents payable or entire payments, if necessary, and
                Restart the Build Payments process when the errors have been resolved
        If Stop Process for Review After Creation of Proposed Payments is enabled in the Payment Processing Request
            The PPR status is set to Pending Proposed Payment Review.
            This status prevents further processing until user takes action.
            Click on 'Start Action' (on Payment Manager) to review proposed payments (on the 'Review Proposed Payments' page)
                Or you can click on the Payment Processing Request (from Payment Manager) to drill to the payment details
                For each payment, you can choose to drill down to the Scheduled Payments that it comprises
                You can change the Maturity Date on Bills Payable
                You can change the Payee Bank Account which is defaulted down from the Supplier Site
                     This is only allowed if the Disbursement System Option "Allow Payee Bank Account Override on Proposed Payments" is set
                     Navigation: Payments Setup > Funds Disbursement Setup > Disbursement System Options
                You can also remove payments by selecting them and removing them
                You can also remove documents from a payment
                Once completed you can choose 'Run Payment Process' to continue.
                    This will start the Formatting process - which creates the payment instructions
        Documents are validated against Payment Method validations and Payment Format validations by IBY_VALIDATIONSETS_PUB
            If all documents pass validation, they are assigned 'VALIDATED' status and the Payment Process Request status is set to 'Documents Validated'
            Documents that fail validation are handled according to the Validation Level on the Payment Process Request:
                REQUEST (reject all), DOCUMENT (reject only individual documents), PAYEE (reject all for a supplier), NONE (stop the request for review)
            Documents that fail validation are released for future pay runs
        You can click on 'Rejected and Removed Items' (from Payment Manager') to see scheduled payments that were rejected or removed
            For each rejection, you can click on the reference number to see the reason for the rejection
        Concurrent Process 'Group into Payments' runs (IBY_PAYGROUP_PUB)
            The validated documents are then grouped into proposed payments based on the grouping rules, both user defined and hard coded.
                e.g. If exclusive_payment_flag = Y on a document, its paid on a separate payment.
                Grouping is done by Payment Method and additional grouping rules defined in the Payment Process Request (e.g. payment date)
             Payments are internally numbered and validated and inserted in IBY_PAYMENTS_ALL
             IBY_DOCS_PAYABLE_ALL is updated with the payment_id and formatting_payment_id values that corresponding to the payment that pays the document.
        A record is inserted in IBY_PAY_SERVICE_REQUESTS for the Payment Process Request with CALL_APP_PAY_SERVICE_REQ_CODE = CHECKRUN_NAME
            This table has REQUIRE_PROP_PMTS_REVIEW_FLAG to determine if payments should be reviewed, and CREATE_PMT_INSTRUCTIONS_FLAG to automatically submit the Payment Instructions process
            Valid statuses for the Payment Process Request in this table are:
                DOCUMENTS_VALIDATED, INFORMATION_REQUIRED, INSERTED , PAYMENTS_CREATED, PENDING_REVIEW, TERMINATED, VALIDATION_FAILED
        Records are inserted into IBY_DOCS_PAYABLE_ALL for the payments that are built
            The link to the Payment Processing Request is through PAYMENT_SERVICE_REQUEST_ID.
            If the Payment Process Request has the internal bank account and payment profile assigned to it, these are assigned to all the documents IBY_DOCS_PAYABLE_ALL
                This is done by IBY_ASSIGN_PUB code
        If There are No Errors and Process Stop was not Requested
            The status of the Payment Processing Request is set to Payments Created.
            In this status, payment instruction can be created for the Payment Processing Request.
    Formatting Payment Instructions
        The CREATE_PMT_INSTRUCTIONS_FLAG can be a Y or N in the Payment Processing Request when it was originally defined
            Yes (Y) - Payment Instruction will be automatically created after payments are created.
                If the PPR is setup to automatically submit instruction, the payment_service_request_id will be populated in iby_payment_instructions_all
                    This is because the instruction will be specific to the PPR
                    In this case, the instruction can be linked to the PPR using PAYMENT_SERVICE_REQUEST_ID
            No (N) - Application waits for standard request submission for Payment Instruction.
                If the PPR processing is setup for the user to submit the instruction as a standard request, then
                when the instruction is submitted, it is linked to the PPR through the payments selected by the instruction.
        The setting of the flag CREATE_PMT_INSTRUCTIONS_FLAG gives two options for creating payment instructions
            Directly within a Payment Processing Request or
            Indirectly in Standard Request Submission (for multiple Payment Processing Requests)
        For a single Payment Processing Request, select the action 'Run Payment Process' in the Payment Processing Request page
            This submits the Payments Build and Formatting process (from Payment Manager)
            This is an  IBY process to Create Payments and Format Payment Documents for a single Payment Processing Request
                You cannot do this from the Payment Instruction tab - this tab is used for querying back existing payment instructions only
            It comprises restarting 'Build Payments' (IBYBUILD) with the option to kick off 'Format Payment Instructions with Text Output'
            A record is inserted into IBY_PAYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS_ALL - this stores the payment instruction information.
            Concurrent Process 'Format Payment Instructions' (IBY_PAYINSTR_PUB) runs and generates the payment instructions files.
                This process applies any grouping rules defined in the Payment Processing Request
            Formatting the Payment Instruction File includes several steps
                Numbers the payments - Check Numbering
                Creates XML Extract message
                Passes the extract to XML publisher
                Applies the format template via XML Publisher (BI publisher)
                BI publisher formats and stores the output
                The output is stored in the location defined by the 'Payment Instructions Format' setup area on the Payment Process Profile including:
                    Outbound Payment File Prefix
                    Outbound Payment File Extension
                    Outbound Payment File Directory
                Oracle Payments then updates the status of the Payment Instruction and the Payments.
                    If successful, the status of Payments and Instruction is Formatted.
                    If successful for paper checks, the status of Payments and Instructions is 'Formatted - Ready for Printing'
                        Printing can be started by choosing the 'Action' icon for this payment instruction
                        It opens the' Print Payment Documents' page
                There can be multiple payment instructions for a payment process request because multiple payment process profiles are allowed in the manual assignment step
                The payment instructions are given a Reference Number and listed below the Payment Process Request once completed
        For multiple Payment Processing Requests, run 'Create Electronic Payment Instructions' from Standard Request Submission
            This will kick off the additional job 'Format Payment Instruction with Text Output' once it is complete
            Or you can run 'Create Printed Payment Instructions' for paper checks
            Specify the 'Payment Process Profile' parameter to create a payment instruction across multiple similar payment processing requests that use the same Payment Process Profile
                Criteria can include: Payment Process Profile, Currency, Internal Bank Account, Payment Process Request and Payment Document
            Specify the 'Create Electronic Payments - Transmit Now' option to have the electronic payment file transmitted automatically
                This option is also available on a Payment Processing Profile definition for straight-through processing (on the 'Payment System' tab)
        Every payment is assigned an internal 'Payment Reference Number' which is displayed on payment pages and used in Searches
            It is not the check number (payment document number) or payment instruction number
        If the Create Payment Instructions program finds validation errors (based on validations that apply at the 'Payment Instruction' validation point)
            The Instruction creation process is stopped for review
            The Resolve Payment Instruction Validation Errors page can be used to review, resolve and over-ride validation errors
            Resolutions can include removing payments from the instruction or changing setups or third party payee data and resubmitting the instruction build and validation process
    Print Checks or Perform Electronic Transmission
        If the action was taken earlier to print payment documents, you can choose 'Print' from the 'Print Payments Document' page
        Print Checks if Payments are manual (from Payment Manager)
        Users can load stationery into the printer and print checks at this stage.
        Determine if the checks printed ok. If not reprint
    Transmit Payment Instructions if Payments are Electronic (concurrent process)
        Check on the Funds Disbursement Dashboard for all Payment Instructions in status 'Formatted - Ready to Transmit'
            Choose the 'Action' button to start the transmission process' to start the transmission and payment confirmation process
    Confirm Payments
        Code: AP_PMT_CALLOUT_PKG
        'Record Print Status' of the checks to confirm the payments. Oracle Payments calls ap_pmt_callout_pkg.payment_completed to confirm the payments.
            This is an action available from the Payment Instruction
            A page displays to show checks used, skipped, or used for overflow checkstup processing
            Review the information and click 'Continue' to get a warning - the following action cannot be reversed
                Payments will be marked as complete - undoing will require voiding the process
                This starts the concurrent process 'Record Print Status'
            Click 'Apply' to display the 'Funds Disbursement Administrator' Window
                You can monitor the request to confirm print status from this window.
                This does the following:
                Assigns sequence/values Document sequencing.
                Creates data in AP_CHECKS_ALL with appropriate data from IBY tables.
                    Checkrun_name = ppr name and checkrun_id = checkrun_id from IBY table.
                Data inserted into AP_INVOICE_PAYMENTS_ALL for the corresponding checks.
                AP_PAYMENT_SCHEDULES_ALL for the invoices are updated to indicate the payment details and status.
                The documents paid in this PPR are released by setting the checkrun_id on the payment schedules to null.
                AP_INVOICES_ALL is udpated to show payment status
                Data is deleted from the AP_SELECTED_INVOICES_ALL
                Data is deleted from AP_UNSELECTED_INVOICES_ALL
            The concurrent program 'Payment Instruction Register' shows the actual payments made
    View and Void Payment Instructions
        You can view and void existing payment instructions from the Payment Instructions Tab in Payments Manager
        You can terminate and rollback the payment instruction if the status is not 'Formatted' or 'Printed'
    View Payments
        You can view payments within payment instructions from the Payments Tab in Payments Manager
        You can search for individual payments
        You can stop a payment and release a stop (for example, if the payment/check document is found and the stop is not wanted)
        You can confirm the stop payment which means the payment has been stopped by the bank
            Once a payment stop is confirmed, the stop can not be released

Period-End Processing and Close
    Reference: Period Close Advisor: E-Business Suite (EBS) [ID 335.1]
        Contains period close instructions for all Subledgers and General Ledger
    Period-End Close includes closing all subledgers then closing the General Ledger
    Within each subledger, steps include:
        Moving all accounting transactions to the General Ledger
        Closing the subledger
    Once all subledgers are closed, run the 'Subledger Period Close Exception Report'
        Reference: R12: How to Use the Subledger Period Close Exceptions Report for Period Close Activity? [ID 793598.1]
        This will identify any accounting problems that need to be reviewed and resolved.
    The sequence of closing subledgers in period-end processing accounts for dependencies between applications
    The sequence for closing subledgers is:
        Close Payables - the first subledger to close
            Payables must close before Fixes Assets, Projects and Purchasing
            Payables invoices create Mass Additions in FA, Costs in Projects
            Payables invoices also reduce the purchasing accruals for goods received not invoiced
            Payables create project costs (expenses)
        Close Purchasing
            Purchasing must close after Payables and before Inventory
        Close Inventory
            Inventory must close after Purchasing and before Order Management
            Inventory close ensures no additional shipments that generate receivables and COGS
        Close Projects
            Projects must close after Payables and Inventory and before Receivables (for Project Billing)
        Close Order Management
            Order Management does not create accounting transactions
                It determines when accounting for Cost of Goods Sold and Revenue are done
                Order Management must close after Inventory and before Receivables
        Close Receivables
            Receivables must close after Projects and Order Management
                Order Management can trigger shipments from Inventory
                Order Management can trigger invoices in Accounts Receivable
        Close Fixed Assets
            Fixed Assets must close after Payables
        Close General Ledger
            General Ledger must close after Fixed Assets and Receivables
            Several processes occur in General Ledger before it is closed
                Mass Allocations
                Adjusting Entries
                Recurring Entries
                Consolidations
                Eliminations
                Revaluations (after consolidations are done)
    Close Diagnostics
        Also see: Support Diagnostics
        Reference: Diagnostic Test Catalog for 12.1.3 [ID 1083807.1] (search on Closing diagnostics for different applications)
            Many modules have diagnostics that can be run before or during the close
            Reference: 'Oracle Diagnostics Pack for R12' (search in Metalink)
            General Ledger Close Diagnostics
            Receivables Close Diagnostics

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Troubleshooting, Tips and Tricks
    Project costing is often used as a budgeting tool in place of turning on budgets in GL
        Budgetary controls in GL require encumbrance accounting features to be activated with a lot of overhead
        Project accounting provides selective budgetary control over specific expenditures "charged" to projects
    Task numbers should be segmented based on level (eg 01.05.11 is a three level WBS) because many forms arrange these tasks alphanumerically in a display.
        Task names with these embedded numbers can be 20 characters long, but task descriptions can be 250 chars
    Use templates to define projects using common terminology for similar tasks
        This helps ensure meaningful analysis and reporting across projects
    Capture projects, tasks, expenditure types and expenditure organizations at the point of data entry for feeder systems
        This includes: procurement, time, expenses, to ensure consistancy of project data across systems

                Each AFE Owner must exist in the HR System in order to be added as a Key Project Member
            It can also be done by using a Descriptive Flexfield at the Project Level

    What is the relevance of Project Status and What is the Meaning of Each
        Project Statuses are setup during configuration or accepted based on the seeded values
            Navigation: Setup -> System -> Statuses -> Filter on Status Type = 'Project'
            There is a User Status and System Status - user statuses can be added but must be associated with System Statuses
                Oracle uses the System Status to control project behaviour
            Oracle provides seeded user statuses but you can define more in the Statuses Window
            Status Values have Status Controls and Next Allowable Statuses
                Status Controls show what is possible on an project with a given status
                You check or uncheck each status control to modify the activities allowed for each status
                    The default setting is the Oracle seeded setting and cannot be changed - it is shown for reference only
                Next Allowable Statuses show what valid status changes can be made
                    Next Allowable Statuses setup are: Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Closed, Pending Close, Teco
            The primary project statuses are:
                Unapproved
                Submitted
                Approved
                Rejected
                Pending Closed
                Closed
                Pending Purge - can apply to previously Open or Closed projects
                Partially Purged - transactions purged but master and summary data retained (must have been Closed initially)
                Purged - transactions and summary data purged but master data retained (must have been Closed initially)
            Each of these statuses is defined as allowing transitions to the other statuses

    What is the meaning of 'Future' in Project GL Periods
        The GL Period Statuses of 'Future' and 'Open' have the same privileges (they allow posting of transactions and interfacing of journals to the General Ledger).
        The period status 'Future' is normally used if other modules are open for a period where Projects is not yet open (e.g. Purchasing or Payables) and interfaced transactions must be accepted in Projects.
        When users transact directly into Projects the status should be changed to 'Open'. If the period statuses in other systems are kept the same as the periods in Projects, then Future is not used.
    How do you determine the Project Expenditure Item Ending Date for Expenditure Entry
        Look at the 'Expenditure Cycle Start Day' in Setup -> System -> Implementation Options -> Expnd/Costing
        This shows the start day for each expenditure period from which you can derive the end-day/dates

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on General Functionality
    Projects includes:
        Project Costing - for tracking project costs against budgets,
            Costing collects information about project costs
        Project Billing - for billing project based revenue,
            Billing is used to bill out projects based on completions and calculate project profitability
        Project Connect for MS Project - to exchange setups with MS Projects
        Activity Management Gateway - for uploading project setups
        Projects Analysis Collection Pack
    The fundamental form of a project is it's tasks and subtasks (aka Work Breakdown Structure or WBS)
        The number of levels in a WBS is unlimited
    Projects are owned by operating units and every project is assigned to an OPU
        The OPU is viewable on the main projects maintenance form
    Projects can be one of three separate 'type' classes:
        Capital (construction-in-process and capitalized on completion),
        Indirect (overhead expenses like Admin or Legal eventually charged out to other projects),
        Contract (billable to clients)
    Capital projects are interfaced to Fixed Assets at the time they are capitalized.
        One project can generate many assets (through grouped tasks)
    Indirect projects  are charged with overheads (like a project office or employee overheads) where each item is a specific overhead item.
        The allocations feature in 11i charges the overheads out to other projects
    Contract projects can be billed out to clients on different bases: time and expense, fixed price, cost plus.
        Funding is required for any contract project, through a customer agreement.
        One agreement can fund multiple projects (like construction and operations)
        A revenue budget is also required for a contract project
            The project must be baselined (budget fixed) before revenue can be generated.
    Projects support budgets and progress for expenditures against budget
        Budgets can be multiple types: including plan and forecast
        Expenditure organizations on projects establish budgets of what they can spend
    Projects is not a project management system used to schedule activities, assign resources and manage deliverables
        It does not support progress tracking, critical pathing, resource allocations and leveling, task dependencies and PERT analysis
        Projects is a subledger that tracks Work in Progress or Construction in Progress for accounting purposes
    Projects is a subledger to GL and posts costs and billed revenues
    Projects maintains costs from Purchasing and Payables from the earliest point of commitments and obligations
        Projects tracks commitments before invoicing occurs
        It also interface recognized revenue to the GL
    Project costs are charged and maintained within business groups
        employees in one business group cannot charge a project owned by another business group
    The business group Organization is the owner of the project burdening organization hierarchy
        So all burdening must be within the business group that owns the project.
    Revenue and expenditures are tracked to the owning organization of a project.
    Costs are tracked by Expenditure Type and Expenditure Category
        Expenditure types are cost classifications such as Direct Labor, Indirect Labor, Electricity, etc
        Expenditure Categories group expenditure types: eg. Labor, Materials, Miscellaneous, Utilities etc.
            See Project Costing Users Guide, Chapter 2 Expenditures/Overview of Expenditures/Expenditure Classifications

            Navigation: <Project Costing Superuser>/Setup/Expenditures/Expenditure Types
    Key members (employees) assigned to a project can view and update project details.
        They are assigned based on roles which limit their privileges
        The profile option "PA: Cross Project User -- View" allows non-key members to view project details
            They can only view projects owned by their Operating Unit (based on their current responsibility)
            It will not allow them to view labor costs, which are sensitive data in many companies
        The profile option "PA: Cross Project User -- Update" allows non-key members to change project details
            They can only update projects owned by their Operating Unit (based on their current responsibility)
    The reporting hierarchies and starting points for an OPU can be viewed in Project Setups
        Navigation: Projects/Setups/System/Implementation Options (System, Project Setup, Expnd/Costing)
        These hierarchies can be viewed in Org setups
            Navigation: PSU/Resources and Organizations/HR Foundation/Work Structures/Organization/Hierarchy
    Quick entry fields are defined to assist in setting up a project quickly
    Transactions imported from other systems are assigned a transaction source.
        The source determines whether the transaction has already been accounted in the GL by setting the source to 'pre-accounted'
        Account generater will not pick up these pre-accounted transactions inside projects.
        Transaction sources for seeded setups are defaulted to 'pre-accounted'
        Only adjustments to the transactions made within Projects will require account distributions
    'PRC:Distribute Usage and Miscellaneous Costs' distributes costs based on usage and assigns accounting distributions to charge lines
        It takes the quantity of a cost transaction like machine units and calculates costs
            Costs are based on raw cost rates from non-labor resource setups
            Calculation includes burdens to arrive at total burdened costs
    The 'Generate Draft Revenues' process calculates draft revenues  from cost lines and revenue events
        It determines the distribution of revenue accounts
    Followup processes to 'Generate Draft Revenue' are to:
        run 'Interface Revenue to GL' (for unearned revenue),
        run 'Generate Draft Invoice' (for unbilled receivables) and
        run 'Interface Invoices to Receivables' processes
    'Streamline processes' in Projects group multiple interface jobs into request sets to run more efficiently
        Streamline processes are:
            PRC:Submit Interface Streamline Process, and
            PRC: Submit Project Steamline Process
    Implementation of HR will disable the HR related maintenance forms in Projects
        All maintenance must be done through the HR forms (which are more extensive)
    Inventory is issued to a project by capturing the project, task, expenditure type and expenditure org in the picking/issue transaction
        For capital projects, PA posts journals to GL for CIP costs (DR Project CIP, CR Liability) and then
            CR: Project CIP, DR Assets when placed in service date is processed and mass additions is run to create the fixed asset.
    Project expenses can be entered directly into Oracle Projects as an alternative to posting into Self Service Expenses
        PA will transfer them to AP as liabilities, and AP will post to the ledger.

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Project Statuses
    The primary project statuses are:
        Unapproved
        Submitted
        Approved
        Rejected
        Pending Closed
        Closed
        Pending Purge - can apply to previously Open or Closed projects
        Partially Purged - transactions purged but master and summary data retained (must have been Closed initially)
        Purged - transactions and summary data purged but master data retained (must have been Closed initially)
        Each of these statuses is defined as allowing transitions to the other statuses
    Reference: Oracle Projects Implementation Guide > Project Definition > Defining Statuses and Status Profile Options
    Navigation: Project Superuser -> Setup > System > Statuses > Status Type = 'Project'
        There are two tabs: 'Functions' and 'Workflow'
    There are several project status types: Project, Task, Assignment, Progress Status (of a task), Candidate, Control Item, Deliverable, Deliverable Action, Funding
        Each status type applies to a different series of statuses with different purpposes: e.g. project level vs. task level
    Statuses are user defined or seeded and inclued a user status and internal system status - any new user status must be assigned to an internal system status
        This way Oracle knows from the System Status how to treat the new status and what rules to apply
    For the 'Project' Status Type, typical project user statuses (which are predefined by Oracle) are: Unapproved, Submitted for Approval, Approved, Pending Close, Closed
    You can create new user project statuses or use the seeded ones and modify their attributes
    Attributes of statuses include:
        Description - user entered description (not used by Oracle on seeded statuses)
        Effective From - effective to date
        Effective To - effective end date
        Starting Flag - indicates if the status can be used as a starting status for the object to which it applies
    Each user status (you can define additional ones) must map to a predefined internal 'System Status' on this form
        Each system status determines the available Status Controls (actions) that are allowed for the user status
        Check or uncheck the Status Controls  to make then available or unavailable for a specific status
            The 'Default' check box is display-only and shows the original setting seeded by Oracle
    Transitions between these status can be managed by a Project Status Workflow (optional)
        Workflow approval can be implemented globally or for specific projects only (e.g. large projects)
        Workflow approval can also be implemented for specific transitions (e.g. from 'Submitted' to 'Approved')
            You enable workflow for a specific status with the 'Enable Workflow' checkbox on the Workflow Tab of the Status Maintenance form

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Periods and Period Statuses
    Projects has two period types: PA Periods and GL Periods
        PA Periods are used for reporting
            PA Periods can be more frequent or the same as GL Periods
            These must be open in order to choose a period on Project Status Inquiry
        GL Periods are used for accounting
            GL Period Maintenance is controlled by the Implementation Option 'Maintain Common PA and GL Periods'
                If this option is set in Projects Implementation Options, period statuses can only be updated to GL Period Statuses
                    Click 'Copy from GL' in 'Maintain PA Period Statuses' to update period statuses to match GL
                If this option is not set, period statuses can be maintained in Projects directly
                    Edit period statuses directly in 'Maintain PA Period Statuses' to update period statuses
    Period Statuses are
        Never Opened - the initial project status. You can enter budgets and forecasts but you cannot post transactions
        Future - has the same privileges as 'Open' and is intended for use in accepting transactions from other modules which are open earlier than Projects for the same period
        Open - allows posting of transactions and interfacing to the general ledger. Open is normally set when transactions are entered directly into Projects even though the period may have been 'Future Open' to allow interfaced transactions earlier
        Pending Close - prevents entry of new transactions but allows corrections to existing transactions
        Closed - used to prevent the posting of transactions
        Permanently Closed - cannot be reopened

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Creating Expenditure Items
    Navigation: Expenditures -> Pre-Approved Batches -> Enter
        Enter a batch, and expenditure lines
        Note that all expenditures can be imported through the standard interface for expenditure item import (e.g. Maximo)
    Transactions can be uploaded via WebADI
        See Oracle Costing User Guide 'Uploading Expenditures from Microsoft Excel'
        Transactions are loaded into PA_TRANSACTION_INTERFACE_ALL initially
        The Integrator for this function is 'Projects - Transaction Import'
        You have the option of automatically importing transactions from the ADI Template
            The template submits 'PRC: Transaction Import' to import the transactions
        You must use a valid Expenditure Item Ending Date
            Check the correct value in Setup -> System -> Implementation Options -> Expenditure Cycle Start Day
    Once an expenditure batch is entered, click 'Submit' to submit for review and approval
        Batches will remain in working status until submitted
        While in working status they can be modified and deleted
    Click 'Release' to release submitted batches for distribution
        Once a batch is released it can no longer be reworked or deleted - it must be reversed

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Transferring Costs Between Projects
    You can transfer costs between projects by querying the cost
    Find the expenditure items in Expenditure Item Inquiry and choose 'Transfer' from the menu
    Enter the new project and task and click OK
    Run the cost distribution process to create accounting.

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Transaction Import
    Transactions are loaded into the PA_TRANSACTION_INTERFACE_ALL and imported by runnning the 'PRC: Transaction Import' concurrent process
    All transactions in a single batch are rejected if a single transaction is in error
        You must page through all the good transactions in a batch to find the one or two bad transactions
        A quicker way is to query transactions in PA_TRANSACTION_INTERFACE_ALL to find the items with error reasons
    The are loaded with Released Status so cannot be reworked and deleted, they must be reversed.
    You can delete items from a batch in the interface table
        Navigation: Expenditures > Transaction Import > Review Transactions
        The transaction Review form does not support selecting multiple transactions

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Transaction Controls
    Transaction Controls limit what can be charged to a project
        They also allow rules about what items are capitalizable vs. non-capitalizable
    Transaction controls are setup within each project by adding the attribute to the Project Template
    Transaction Controls can be inclusive or exclusive (they are exclusive by default)
        This is controled by the check box 'Limit to Transaction Controls' on the Transaction Controls Setup Form

Project Costing and Billing (PA) Notes on Project Costing Processes
    Costing is the processing of expenditures to determine their full costs and to determine their charge accounts
    Expenditures processed by Project Costing include:
        Pre-approved expenditures: labor(timesheets), expenses (expense reports), usages (purchase order), usages and miscellaneous transactions
        Burden costs
        Expenses submitted via Oracle Internet Expenses
        Supplier invoices from AP
        Imported expenditures
        Adjusted expenditures requiring re-costing
    The primary processes in Project Costing are:
        Enter transactions or import transactions
        Distribute Costs (calculate raw and standard costs, calculate burdens, calculate curency conversions, assign accounting distributions)
        Perform Accounting
        Interface transactions to AP (Project Expense Reports) and GL (costs not already accounted)

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Auto Accounting
    Tricks and Tips
        Always specify a warehouse on an invoice line to pick up the revenue account for an item
            Otherwise it will pull the revenue account from the master org for the item
        References:
            How is Revenue Account Derived For Manual Invoices Based On Standard Lines (Doc ID 1340582.1)
    Autoaccounting is used within projects to assign GL accounts to transactions entered directly into Projects
    Account Generator on the other hand is used to derive project accounts in requisitions, purchase orders and payables invoices
        Primary accounting includes:
            liability accounts for costs,
            accounts for unbilled receivables and unearned revenue
            accounts for costs entered directly into Projects and not from interfaced systems
        This applies to transactions that were not coded by feeder systems such as purchasing
            (i.e.  where the source is not tagged as 'pre-accounted')
        Autoaccounting also assigns accounts for transactions originating within Projects
    Autoaccounting is primarily used to build the distribution for labor costs not pre-accounted by feeder systems.
        Other transactions are mostly pre-accounted in the feeder systems to Projects
    How it works
        AutoAccounting consists of predefined accounting functions that are called by processes that create accounting values (e.g.'Distribute' processes)
            These functions are predefined and cannot be extended by setup or configuration - you choose which ones you need to use
        Each function is a assigned an autoaccounting rule that has the logic to derive the account values
            Within each autoaccounting function are function transactions that provide additional granularity - different function transactions can be assigned different rules
            Oracle defines the transactions within each autoaccounting function - you cannot extend them by configuration or setup
            Individual function transactions can be enabled or disabled under each autoaccounting function
            Enabled function transactions must be assigned autoaccounting rules
            If Oracle needs a rule on a function transaction and it is not defined and enabled, it uses a fallback transaction for the function
            Within each accounting function there is an 'all transaction'transaction that is the highest level fallback segment rule
            Note that autoaccounting rules can be set up once for a given chart of accounts but the assignment of those rules to function transactions is operating unit specific
        Each autoaccounting rule can be further defined by lookup sets
        When the autoaccounting function is called by a distribution process, it looks up the assigned rule and uses it to derive the account
        Each autoaccounting rule supplies only one segment value (called segment/rule pairings) so you need to assign a rule for each segment and assign it to an accounting function
        An autoaccounting rule first derives an 'intermediate value' which can be a constant, a parameter or a SQL statement result
        Autoaccounting uses this value as the segment value if no Lookup Set is defined. If a lookup set is defined, it uses the value as a lookup of the final segment value
            If the intermediate value is one of several predefined parameters (e.g. Project Organization) the lookup set can be defined to return a different segment value for different project organization values
            If the intermediate value is a SQL Statement, the returned value can be based on more than one 'parameter' by coding this logic in the SQL Statement
                The purpose of a SQL statement is to support rules based on mor than one parameter - not to supplement the existing list of parameters (SQL Statements have a performance hit)
                Use the rule parameters region on the AutoAccounting rule definition form to define inputs to the SQL (referenced in the SQL statement as binds, e.g. ':1', ':2' etc)
        You can define the intermediate value to be the actual segment value on the form by setting the Segment Value Source to 'Intermediate Value'
            Otherwise define a lookup set before defining the AutoAccounting rule and assign the lookup set as the segment value
        A lookup set is defined from the Lookup Set button in the Segment Value region of the AutoAccounting Rules definition form
            A lookup set is a set of name/value pairs hwere the name is the intermediate value and the resulting value is the segment value that is used for the account
    Autoaccounting is used by cost processes to determine account distributions for:
        Distribute Labor Costs,
        Interface Expense Reports to Payables,
        Interface Labor Costs to GL,
        Distribute Usage Costs,
        Interface Total Burdened Costs to GL,
        Distribute total Burdened Costs, and
        Distribute Expense Reports
    Autoaccounting is used by revenue processes to determine accounts for:
        Generate Draft Revenue
    Autoaccounting FAQ's are in Metalink Note 223031.1

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Multiple Reporting Currencies (MRC)
    You must export journal entries to the primary set of books before the secondary set of books if MRC is enabled

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Major Setups:
    Primary Setups include:
        Project Types - include a default service type for a Project
        Service Types - at the task level
        Template Projects

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Creating New Projects:
    You can only create a new project by copying from an existing project or template
        Oracle will force you to select a template or existing project first (i.e. 'Find' dialog)
    You can also upload a project via WebADI

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Project Cost Budgets
    Budgets are created as Draft and in Working or Submitted status (submitted for baselining)
    Each baseline has an incremented budget version number
    Successive baselines can be copied to create a new draft and the version number of the draft is always 1
        This applies to working and submitted drafts
        When the submitted budget is baselined, the version becomes the next higher available version number
        The original draft version number 1 is always retained after baselining
        If you copy a baseline budget to a new draft, the existing draft is overwritten
    PA_BUDGET_VERSIONS stores all the budget versions
    Budget Entry Methods
        Time-phased - allows entry by GL Period, PA Period or Date Range
        Inception to Completion

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Project Status Inquiry (PSI):
    Project Status Inquiry (PSI) is a set of forms that displays summary project info and drilldowns as of a specified date
        The information is only as current as the last time the 'PRC: Update Project Summary Amounts' job was run
        The period also defaults to the current reporting period set in PA Periods
            You can change the current reporting period in PA Periods to any period value
            Navigation: PA Periods > PA Periods > Ctrl-F11 (Blind Query) > Set Reporting Period (button) > Enter New Reporting Period > OK
        The PSI forms are configurable through a column setup (Projects/Setups/Project Status Columns)
    A concurrent process 'Update Project Summary Accounts' populates accumulation tables which support the Project Status Inquiry form
        So the status is current as of the last run for this process
    The PA Period 'Reporting Period' flag controls the period shown at the top of the Project Status Inquiry main form
        If the PA Period 'Reporting Period' has not been advanced during the month-end close you can do it at any time
         Navigation: PA Periods > PA Periods > Ctrl-F11 (Blind Query) > Set Reporting Period (button) > Enter New Reporting Period > OK
    PSI displays commitments (all project related purchase orders whether or not interfaced to Projects)
    The full list of PSI processes includes:
        PRC: Refresh Transaction Summary Amounts (PAXACRPT)
        PRC: Refresh Project Summary Amounts (PAXACRTA)
        PRC: Update Project Summary Amounts for a Single Project (PAXACMPT_SINGLE)
        PRC: Update Project Summary Amounts (for a Range of Projects) (PAXACMPT)
        PRC: Update Project Summary Amounts after a Resource List Change (PAXACRLT)
    Accumulation of project status is done in four periods:
        inception to date,
        year to date,
        prior period and
        period to date, for budget and actual numbers for costs and revenues
    Project Status Inquiry (PSI) supports drilldown from summary totals through the task structure
        It drills into resources and as far as idividual transactions
    There are three views supporting the PSI forms
        PA_STATUS_PROJ_V
        PA_STATUS_TASK_V
        PA_STATUS_RSRC_V
    The base tables underlying PSI that hold accumulated values for projects are:
        PA_TXN_ACCUM - updated but not period dependent
        PA_RESOURCE_ACCUM_DETAILS - updated but not period dependent
        PA_PROJECT_ACCUM_HEADERS - updated for the current period
        PA_PROJECT_ACCUM_ACTUALS - updated for the current period
        PA_PROJECT_ACCUM_BUDGETS - updated for the current period
        PA_PROJECT_ACCUM_COMMITMENTS - updated for the current period
    Technical notes include:
        PSI Frequently Asked Questions Note: 222320.1
        PSI Troubleshooting Guide Note 222659.1
    Exercise: Inquire Project Status -> PBSU/Project Status/Project Status Inquiry, and use the find button to locate the project.
        Inquire on multiple project attributes, costs, commitments, events, invoices through a dashboard for the project

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Allocations and Burdening:
    Burdening uses a cost group (of items in a project) and burden multiplier to gross up the costs by the burden amount to cover overhead
    Allocations is new to 11i and allocates actual costs from another project
        (or parts of another project - 'Project Sources')
        or from GL accounts ('GL Sources')
        and charges these costs directly to a project
    Allocations are rule-based. They define the source of the costs, the targets and the method for spreading the costs to the target items
    Allocation rules can be grouped with Autoallocation sets to run as a request set (together with GL allocations) for parallel or step-down allocations
    Define an allocation rule -> PBSU/Allocations/Allocation Rules, and enter the rule and sources for the allocation and the project and line targets
    Establish a burden base -> PBSU/Setup/Costing/Burden, ...

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Billing and Revenue Accruals:
    Contract projects (class = contract) allow for accrual of revenue directly to the GL, or billing as a draft invoice into receivables
    Revenue can be accrued on a project as it is earned, then billed on the project according to the customer agreement.
        This allows revenue recognition on the ledger ahead of actual revenue
    Revenue accrual debits unbilled AR, and credits Revenue. Billing credits unbilled AR, and debits AR.
    Invoices are sent to Receivables through the AR Invoice Open Interface and processed by Autoinvoice.
        GL is updated from AR and not from Projects
    A contract project must be funded before revenue can be accrued or billed.
        If existing funding is fully used, no further revenue or billing will take place
    Revenue and billing can be done using one of several 'distribution rules' in the project setup:
        on a cost (actual vs budgeted costs determine revenue percent),
        event (specific milestone events) or
        work basis
    Interproject billing (within the same operating unit) is done by billing from one project and running a 'tie-back' process
        It creates a payables invoice to the other project.
        AP sends the payables distribution to projects
    Intercompany billing is used to transfer costs between companies (operating units) for the same project.
        This uses the 'borrowed and lent' process to transfer costs from a project in one org to a project in another.
        Then a cross charge GL journal is used to move the GL entries as well
    If a project is split across legal entities, the sub project in one entity must create an invoice and bill to the other legal entity.
        Invoice tieback is used to create the purchase invoice for the second entity from the receivable invoice in the first entity

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Business Intelligence and Project Analysis Collection Pack (PACP):
    Financials Intelligence includes three pre-built Discoverer workbooks for projects:
        Projects Cost Analysis, Projects Revenue Analysis and Projects Margin Analysis
    PACP is a series of programs that populate a separate star schema for data warehouse inquiry.
        It reports on broader time period options than the PSI form and underlying collection packs
    Database triggers on the base tables set flags to include individual transactions in the next data collection run to export to the star schema
    The PACP schema can be customized and any Oracle reporting tools can be used against it.

Project Costing (PA Schema) Notes on Organizations and Organization Hierarchies Notes:
    Each project is owned by a single operating unit - the Project Operating Unit Owner
    Project numbers and project templates are uniquely numbered across all operating units in an installation
    Customers and suppliers are uniquely numbered across all operating units in an installation
        Customer sites and supplier sites are unique to each operating unit
    Customer agreements are owned by individual operating units
    You can charge expenditures from any organization to any project ...
        as long as the project's "Project Operating Unit" and "Expenditure Operating Units" are eligible for cross-charging
            These are system options within the Projects Responsibility
        and ... as long as the charging organization is classified as a Project Expenditure Operating Unit.
    Project Expenditure Operating Units process all expenditures on a project within their own operating units
        You enter and process expenditures in the "Expenditure Operating Unit"
            These can be expense reports, timecards and non labor resources (e.g. purchases)
        Costs are calculated in the Expenditure Operating Unit at the rates setup for the Expenditure OPU
        Cost burdens are also calculated in the Expenditure Operating Unit
        Journal entries are created in the Expenditure Operating Unit
            The AutoAccounting or Account Generator processes and configs from the Expenditure OPU are used
        Supplier invoices are transfered to Payables within the same Expenditure Operating Unit
        Labor costs are transfered to the GL in the set of books corresponding to the Expenditure Operating Unit
        Expense reports are tranferred to AP within the same Expenditure Operating Unit
            If an expense report is entered into Payables first, it is entered int the Expenditure Operating Unit
            The costs are transferred to Projects in the same Expenditure Operating Unit
        You can view expenditures in projects in either Project Mode, or Cross Project Mode
            Project mode is based on the Project Owning Operating Unit
            Cross-Project mode is based on the Expenditure Operating Units that charged to the project
    Project Owning Operating Units process all revenue and generates invoices from costs processed in Expenditure Units
        AutoAccounting defaults on Project Owning Organizations can drive revenue accounting and reporting
        You enter and process revenues in the "Project Owning Operating Unit"
        The Project Operating Unit calculates draft revenues and draft invoices using bill rates, overrides and multipliers
            It will only pick up costs for billing if the Expenditure Operating Unit has processed them
        The Project Operating Unit uses auto-accounting to create journal entries for billing transactions
        The Project Operating Unit also uses auto-accounting to transfer revenue to GL and transfer invoices to AR
        Project Owning Operating Units can submit reports on a project that cross all Expenditure Operating Units
        Assets created from the project are posted to the Corporate Asset book for the Project Operating Unit
    There are project specific organizations: "project/task owning", "Expenditure", "and "Invoice/Collection"
        A single "project owning" or "project expenditure" organization can roll up to multiple OPU's
        This is because the relationship is maintained in PA_ALL_ORGANIZATIONS which has one row for each rollup
        Projects tracks both the OPU and the Project Org when stamping transactions with Org ID's
    Project/task owning organizations (classification 'PA_PROJECT_ORG' on the HR_ORGANIZATION_INFORMATION table)
        these organizations can be assigned to projects and tasks and 'own'the project
        these project organizations 'receive' from expenditure organizations (see below)
        they are also marked as 'PROJECT' in the PA_ORG_USE_TYPE column on the denormalized PA_ALL_PROJECTS table
        Project owning organizations can be used by Auto-accounting to look up accounting segments for GL coding
        For cross-charge purposes they are the receiving organizations
    Project/Expenditure Event Orgs (classification 'PA_EXPENDITURE_ORG')
        expenditure orgs can charge to projects, track expenditures and hold budgets
        typically many organizations within a company are classifed as expenditure organizations
            This is so that they can charge projects
            It applies to operating unit organizations and lower
            Expenditure Orgs are also normally classified as HR_ORGS so they can have employees (who charge to projects)
        these organizations can be assigned to transactions in projects so these orgs are recorded on project charges
        they 'provide' resources and costs to the project
        they can include HR organizations (i.e. departments) employees are assigned to, for time and expense entry
        they can include operating units where purchases are made and charged to projects
        Thea are also marked as 'EXPENDITURE' in the PA_ORG_USE_TYPE column on the denormalized PA_ALL_PROJECTS table
        expenditure orgs can track expenditures and be assigned/hold expenditure budgets
        they must be in the expenditure hierarchy in order to be charged to a project
    project/invoice collection and (classifiction 'PA_INVOICE_ORG')
    Organization hierarchy setups can be changed in Oracle Projects
    Projects specific org hierarchies begin at the Operating Unit level in the overall Oracle Organization structure
    The main type of project organization is the "project/task" organization type
        A single project/task "typed" project organization is attached to each project as the "owning" organization
            This organization assignemnt is viewable on the main projects maintenance form
            The organization must be a projec/task org type rolling up to an operating unit`
            This means a project can be at the OPU level or lower in a project/task hieararchy
            Individual projects are attached to these organizations
    The allowed reporting hierarchies and starting points for an OPU can be viewed in Project Setups
        Navigation: Projects/Setups/System/Implementation Options (System, Project Setup, Expnd/Costing)
        These hierarchies can be viewed in Org setups
            Navigation: PSU/Resources and Organizations/HR Foundation/Work Structures/Organization/Hierarchy
    Project Organization Hierarchies can be analyzed by getting a list of all operating units and then:
        Looking at the Implementation Options in Projects for each Operating Unit
        Noting the hierarchy types and names and starting points
        Switching over to the HR Hierarchy setups and displaying the hieararchiesd
    Project organization information is stored in a denormalized table PA_ALL_ORGANIZATIONS
        Most Organziation Lists of Values in Projects are based on this table
        This table is not always updated when org definitions change - a source of many bugs
        To force an update, temporarily change the start org for the expenditure or project hierarchy and change it back
            This triggers an update to the PA_ALL_ORGANIZATIONS table
        This table carries the ORGANIZATION_ID, ORG_ID (of the owning OPU), PA_ORG_USE_TYPE (either Project or Expenditure)
    Projects in different business groups can be visible if the profile option "HR:Cross Business Group" is set
    Exercise: Establish project organization hierarchies for an operating unit: Projects Superuser/Setup/System/Implementation Options
        These setups are stored in PA_IMPLEMENTATIONS_ALL

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Cross Charging (Borrowed and Lent, and Inter-Company Billing)
    Cross charging allows expenditure organizations to charge to a project owned by a different organization
        The project owning organization can be a different "project owning" organization, operating unit or legal entity
    It allows a single project to be setup and different organizations to incur expenses and recover their costs
    All the costs are ultimately transferred to the owning organization to capitalize, expense or move to inventory
    Cross charging is accomplished in one of two ways - Borrowed and Lent, or Inter-Company Billing:
        Borrowed and Lent - journal entries are created to relieve the CIP/WIP of the expenditure organization
            There are no invoices created with "Borrowed and Lent" so Project Billing is not required
                This limits Borrowed and Lent activity to projects within a legal entity (otherwise invoices are needed)
            The WIP/CIP account of the project owning organization is charged and the WIP/CIP of the expenditure org is relieved
            Oracle Projects determines the appropriate costs based on transfer pricing rules of the provider and receiver
            It is calculated by the Project Costing process "PRC - Distribute Borrowed and Lent Amounts"
        Intercompany Billing - invoices are created in AR to relieve the CIP/WIP of the expenditure organization
            Companies choose this method for legal and statutory reasons because it creates an invoice payable and receivable
            A physical invoice is created in AP for the owning organization to shift the charge
            Accounting entries are created at legal transfer prices based on the invoices created, through normal AP and AR
        In both cases the owning organization is charged the costs to their CIP/WIP accounts
    Cross charging controls specifically enable and limit cross charging to specific projects and tasks
        Cross charging is only allowed if the Expenditure and Owner Operating Units are enabled for Cross charges
        Cross charge controls can be specified at the operating unit, project and task level
        There are no intra-operating unit cross charge controls
            they are allowed if the project and task are 'owned' by the expenditure operating unit
            i.e. the owner and expenditure organizations on the project are the same
            Transaction controls should be used to limit what can be charged on intra-company charges
        There are several controls for inter-company (operating unit) cross charging
            For the provider, cross charge implementation options on each operating unit allow/disallow cross charging
                They also determine if Borrowed and Lent, or intercompany billing will be used
                If intercompany billing is used, they also specify the billing project that will create the invoice
            For the receiver, they specify whether the OPU will accept cross charges
                The also specify the name of each OPU that will be allowed to cross charge to the receiver
                They also require the specific project to be turned on to accept cross charges
        There are several controls for inter-company (legal entity) cross charging (similar to inter-operating unit controls)
            For the provider legal entity's operating unit, an option is activated to allow inter-company billing
            Specify each receiver operating unit that can be sent cross-charge transactions
        For the receiver, they specify whether the receiving OPU will accept cross charges
            The also specify the name of each OPU that will be allowed to cross charge to the receiver
            They also require the specific project to be turned on to accept cross charges
    Cross Charge Transfer Pricing Rules control calculation of tranfer prices for labor and non-labor cross charges
        Transfer pricing rules are setup between organizations
        Lines can be created at the "project organization/operating unit/legal entity/business group" levels
        Projects will find and use the rules at the lowest applicable organization level
    Additional Controls for Cross Charges
        Cross charges can also be limited by project, task, expenditure type and transaction source
        Client extension rules may also be defined to customize cross charge controls
    Transfer Prices for Cross Charging (Borrowed and Lent vs Inter-Company Billing)
        Transfer prices can be "Legal Transfer Prices" or "Transfer Prices"
            "Legal Transfer Prices" are the prices charged at arm's length between legal entities
            "Transfer Prices" are internally agreed prices charged between organizations within a legal entity
        The transfer price basis may be raw cost, burdened cost or revenue
        The transfer price calculation method defines the calculation rule (including upcharge ratios)
        Currency conversion is done between operating units using the currency options defined for each operating unit
    Transfer price schedules associate rules with provider and receiver organizations
        The simplest schedule would be a single rule used by all organizations
    Processing Flow for Borrowed and Lent Amounts
        The "Provider" operating unit enters expenditure transactions just like any other expenditure transactions
        The "Provider" OPU runs charge distributions in their own company
            Oracle identifies cross charges based on the cross-charge setups
        The "Provider" runs PRC: Distribute Borrowed and Lent Amounts"
            This calculates transfer prices and generates accounting entries
        The "Provider" runs PRC: Interface Cross Charge Distributions to GL
    Logic Used to Determine Cross Charges by Oracle Projects and Related Accounting
        Oracle determines the cross charge organizations for a transaction (provider and receiver)
            This is used to determine intra-company, inter-operating unit or inter-legal entity charge
        Oracle also determines the cross charge method between the entities: borrowed and lent or billed
    Accounting Entries Generated by Cross Charge
        Cross charging debits the receiver's charge account and credits the provider's charge account
        This is actually done by two entries (if the balancing segment of the provider and receiver are the same)
            A "Lent" (Asset) account is debited for the "Provider" cost center
            A "Borrowed" (Liability) account is credited for the "Receiver" cost center
        If the Borrowed and Lent amounts are booked to different balancing segments,
            an inter-company revenue account would be used for offsetting entries
            i.e. Provider DR "Lent" asset/receivable, CR "Inter-Company Revenue" income account
                 Receiver DR "Inter-Company Revenue" income account, CR "Borrowed" liability account
    Setups for Cross Charging

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Capitalization and Assets:
    References
        Information Center: Capital Projects and Asset Capitalization in Oracle Projects R12 (Doc ID 1405456.2)
    Assets can only be created for Capital Projects
        New assets can only be defined and created if the Project Type is has a Project Class of 'Capital'
            Navigation: Projects Superuser -> Setup -> Projects -> Project Types -> (inquire on a Project Type)
        Retirement assets can be created to collect the costs of retiring assets - taking them out of service
            Retirement assets can be created in the same project as new assets, or placed in separate projects
    Assets must have an "In-Service" date attribute populated in order to be sent to Oracle Fixed Assets
        The in-service date must be in the current open FA period or prior period - future dates will not be exported
        The Asset must be changed to 'As-Built' from 'Estimated' to activate the 'In Service Date' field
    Enter or inquire on assets via the project screen -> Options -> Assets
        There may be multiple assets on this screen - displayed one at a time (page through)
    Asset attributes are defined in Projects to allow capitalization of their costs in Fixed Assets
    Assets are assigned to a project or task once they are defined
        Inquire on asset assignments at the project level through "Projects/Options/Asset Information/Asset Assignments"
        Inquire on asset assignments at the task level through "Projects/Tasks/Options/Asset Assignment"

        Metalink Note 866310.1 What Are The Steps to Generate Asset Lines and Interface Them to Oracle Fixed Assets?
    Process Outline for Capitalizing Assets on a Project
        This process applies to one or more assets on a single project
            Each asset can be capitalized at a different time for different amounts even if there is only one task for all assets
        Create an active Project with a Project Type that is Capital
            i.e. the Project Type has a Project Class of 'Capital'
        Post Expenditures to the Project (either Invoices or Non-Invoiced Expenditures)
        Define one or more assets on the Project
            You must fill out all required fields and the Location Flexfield if the option 'Require Complete Asset Definition' is enabled
                Check the value of this option on the Project Type definition
                    Navigation: Project Superuser -> Setup -> Projects -> Project Types -> (query capital project type) -> Capitalization Information
        Assign the assets to the Project or to Tasks on the Project
            If you assign assets to a task then only the costs for that task are capitalizable to the Asset
            You can assign an asset to a summary task or detail task
            You can assign multiple assets to the same task without restricting how and when each asset is capitalized
        Change the Project Asset Type from 'Estimated' to 'As-Built' and assign an Actual Date in Service
            The process that collects Asset Costs for Capitalization is based on the Asset Actual In Service Date
            Navigation: Projects Superuser -> Capitalization -> Capital Projects -> (Find Project) -> Assets (button)
                Change the Project Asset Type from 'Estimated' to 'As-Built' and enter an Actual Date In Service
                The actual in-service date must be in the current or a prior period in order to export
            You do not have to change every asset to 'As-Built' - leave any incomplete assets as 'Estimated' for later capitalization
                Any assets that are 'Estimated' will not be assigned asset lines and exported to Fixed Assets
                Their costs can be left unassigned for later regeneration and assignment
        Create Asset Lines
            This process can be run manually in SRS or through the forms
            Run 'PRC: Generate Asset Lines'
                This process creates asset lines to pass to FA Mass Additions
                    It attempts to assign project costs to Assets but if it cannot, 'unassigned' asset lines are created for manual assignment
                Navigation: Projects Superuser -> Capitalization -> Capital Projects -> (Find Project) -> Generate
            Conditions Required to Meet the Criteria for Capitalizing Costs
                Expenditures must be costed and interfaced to the general ledger before they can be grouped onto asset lines
                The Net Zero flag on the expenditure line must not be checked - net zero lines (accruals reversed later) are not capitalized
                The Grouped CIP flag on the asset line must not be checked - if it is checked then the charge has already been capitalized
                    Note - if the capital amount has not been transfered to assets, it may be regenerated on the next run
                The Capitalizable flag on the expenditure line must be checked
                The Costs Distributed flag on the expenditure lines must be checked - costs must have been previously distributed
                The 'Expenditure Through Date' Through on the 'PRC: Generate Asset Lines' must be on or after the end of the month
                    This is the case if the CIP Grouping Rule is based on the GL or PA period being monthly
                    The log file for each run shows the PA Date Entered and the PA Date used to confirm this
                Assets must be assigned to the tasks where the costs lie
                The project status must allow for capitalization
                The Asset In Service date and Expenditure Date parameters on 'PRC: Generate Asset Lines' must cover the actual dates for these items
                If the project capitalization method for the Project Type includes capitalizing burdened costs the 'Distribute Total Burdened Costs' must be run first
            Bugs in Capitalization
                Lines will not capitalize if the PA_PROJECT_ASSETS.CAPITALIZED_COST values don't match PA_PROJECT_ASSET_LINES.CURRENT_ASSET_COST
                Unpublished Note 386597.1
            The Generated Asset Lines are Grouped in three ways
                1. WBS Grouping -> Costs on a Task are Grouped to An Asset Assigned to the Task (if there is only one asset)
                2. CIP Grouping -> Costs are also grouped based on the Grouping Rules defined for the Project Type
                    A common grouping rule is 'Expenditure Type' where all costs are grouped for the same expenditure type (within the task)
                    This grouping rule is controlled on the Project Type Definition in Setup
                        Navigation: Projects Superuser -> Setup -> Projects -> Project Types -> (Query a Capital Project Type) -> Capitalization Information -> Grouping Method
                    There is a flag on the Project Types/Capitalization region for grouping invoices - if it is unchecked then invoice line charges are not grouped.
                    If invoice line charges are not grouped, the description on the asset line is 'Invoice' '+' <Invoice ID> '+' <Invoice Distribution ID>
                3. Account Grouping -> Costs are grouped based on their CIP Account but not across multiple CIP accounts
                    This is done because Projects sends the CIP account on the Asset Line to Assets to relieve when the Asset is capitalized
            This process can be rerun any number of times - rerunning deletes any asset lines created previously unless the lines have been exported to Fixed Assets
                Both assigned lines (lines actually assigned to a project asset) and unassigned lines are all deleted and regenerated
                If you don't want to lose earlier assignments, export the lines to Fixed Assets before rerunning the process (see below)
        Review the Generated Asset Lines
            Navigation: Projects Superuser -> Capitalization -> Capital Projects -> Lines
            Each line will be assigned to an asset if the assignment rule is unambiguous (e.g. only one asset assigned to a task)
                Unassigned lines may be assigned manually be entering the asset name on each asset line
                Unassigned lines can also be split before assigning to assets
                Assignments can be manually changed
                Asset line descriptions can be manually changed
            You do not have to assign all lines to all assets and place all assets in service at the same time
            Assign only those costs you want to capitalize to the Assets with an Actual In Service Date that will be capitalized
                Any unassigned lines will be over-written and regenerated the next time the 'Generate Asset Lines' process is run
        Run 'PRC: Interface Assets to Oracle Assets' from Standard Request Submission
            This will create Mass Additions in Fixed Assets for the assigned asset lines and in-service assets
            It will build one parent Addition Line in the 'Post' Queue of Mass Additions for each asset
                It will merge all asset lines and their costs under the parent and assign a 'Merged' status in Mass Additions
                If you only have one Asset Line for each Asset in Projects, you will have two lines for each asset in Mass Additions
                     There will be one Parent Asset and one Merged Asset Line from Projects
        Check the Mass Addition Lines in Fixed Assets and Make any Changes
            Inquire on all Mass Additions for the single Project in Fixed Assets
            Navigation: Fixed Assets -> Mass Additions -> Prepare Mass Additions
        Post Mass Additions to create assets for the Mass Addition Lines
            The Post process will pick up all eligible Mass Additions in the 'POST' queue
            Navigation: Fixed Assets -> Mass Additions -> Post Mass Additions
            You cannot limit the posting to mass additions for a single project
    Exercises - inquire into assets on a project
        Project User -> Projects -> (Query Project) -> Options -> Assets -> Asset Information
            Any assets setup on the project will display without requiring a blind query
    You can reverse capitalize an asset and recapitalize it
        The asset must be created in Assets and can be depreciated
        The reversal process generates cost adjustments in Assets to bring the Asset Value to Zero
            Any accumulated depreciation will be reversed in the period the asset costs are adjusted
        Find the Asset from the Capital Projects form (click the Assets button)
            Click Reverse to start the reversal process
            Run Generate Asset Lines to create the asset reversing lines

Project Costing and Billing (PA Schema) Notes on Interfaces:
    Journal Entries to General Ledger
        Important Notes
            Journal entries are inserted into PA_GL_INTERFACE and not GL_INTERFACE
            Running journal import for Projects source journals pulls the values from PA_GL_INTERFACE directly
            You must run a couple of jobs to insert records into PA_GL_INTERFACE after entering, submitting and releasing a miscellaneous expenditure batch
                PRC: Distribute Miscellaneous Costs
                PRC: Interface Miscellaneous Costs
        Implementation Options control this interface:
            Interface Labor Costs to GL
            Interface Usage Costs to GL
            Interface Revenue to GL
        All data flowing from Projects to General Ledger use a seeded source and categories
            Source = Projects
            Categories = Labor Cost, Usage Cost, Total Burdened Cost, Borrowed and Lent, Provider Cost Reclassification, Revenue
        Run the streamline process to export from projects, import to General Ledger and tie-back journals
            The process is PRC: Submit Interface Streamline Process
                This process runs sub-processes:
                    PRC: Distribute Usage and Miscellaneous Costs
                    PRC: Interface Usage and Miscellaneous Costs to General Ledger
                    Journal Import
                    Journal Post
                    PRC: Tieback Usage Costs from General Ledger
            Tie back makes previously exported distributions from Projects eligible for re-export because they failed import to GL
                It marks the transactions as 'Failed' so they can be re-exported
            Journals include cost, revenue and cross-charge transactions
        The Projects Export process gathers all eligible distribution lines and places them in PA_GL_INTERFACE
            The GL Date assigned to the transactions is the end-date of the earliest open or future open period in GL
    Activity Management Gateway (AMG) - to import projects and tasks from a project management tool for setup of projects
        (via PA_TRANSACTIONS_INTERFACE table) and PA:Cost Transactions Import concurrent process
    AMG is a separate product and separately licenced.
        It requires custom wrappers to call and provides calls to PL/SQL packages that load projects
            It also updates and delete projects, and create, update and delete tasks.
    Project Connect - is a subset of AMG API's to import projects and tasks from Microsoft Project.
        It can send percent completes to Oracle and return project definitions and setups to Microsoft during a project.
    Cost Transaction import interface (transaction interface)
        via PA_TRANSACTIONS_INTERFACE_ALL to import costs calculated in purchasing and payables and all other source systems.

Property Manager (PN) Responsbilities:
    PROPERTY MANAGER, VISION OPERATIONS (PMVO)

Property Manager (PN) Best Practices:
    Setup property as a GL subaccount/account in Oracle Cash Management, then use CE functionality to track cash flow and profitability for the property as well as forecasting future cash flows

Property Manager (PN) Notes:
    Property Manager is a new application for Oracle 11i and is a subledger application to the GL
    Manages land based property, records leases, pays rents and makes rent collections
    Allocates the cost of owned or rented property to cost center expense accounts
    Property locations represent designated space within a property and can be defined at multiple levels from building down to office.
    Property locations are a KFF comprising Region or Office Park, Building, Floor, and Office segments. The values within each segment are referred to as aliases
    Floor space for the building is recorded at the building level. Rentable, usable and common space is recorded at the office level and floor level
    A master lease is a lease signed by a tenant for usage of a property. A lease is signed by the landlord to allow the tenant in. These are two terms for the same document
    A lease can include references to several locations
    Leases are recorded in the Edit Lease form.
    Lease classes drive expected rent payments vs rent receipts: rent payments are made on 'Direct' leases, and billing/rent receipts are expected on 'Third Party' and 'Sublease' leases
    Payments and billings are defined under the 'Billings' tab of the lease details, and exported to AR or AP for actual billing and collection, or payment
    Indexed rent is calculated by applying a CPI index escalator to scheduled rent payments
    Lease rent payments and receipts are generated by a concurrent program and transfered to AP and AR, and regenerated whenever the lease definition is changed
    Occupancy can be assigned at any level in the property hierarchy and space usage can be tracked by employee, cost center, or both.
    Integration with other applications includes: AR for scheduled rent receipts, AP for scheduled rent payments, HR for employees as occupants, and GL for normalized rent and accrued liabilities and assets
    Exercise: Enter or modify a lease: PMVO/Leases and Documents/Main Lease/Enter Leases and Documents

Property Manager (PN) Functional Gaps:
    The due date of an invoice for rent payments and receipts is built of the date the scheduled payment is transfered to AR or AP, and not the invoice date

Property Manager (PN) Interfaces:
    Export billing items to AR (PNEXPAR)
    Export payment items to AP (PNEXPAP)
    Purge open interface tables (PNVPURGE)

Property Manager (PN) Concurrent Processes:
    Create Rent Schedules (PNCPMTSC)
    Export or Import Property Locations and Space Allocations to Open Interface Tables (eg to/from CAD systems) (PNEXPCAD/PNIMPCAD)

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Best Practices:
    Global suppliers and Contract Purchasing Agreements (CPO's)
    Consolidated purchase orders - from pooled requisitions to lower admin costs
    Monitoring of contract leakage - value of purchase orders where a purchasing agreement could be used
    Supplier performance monitoring - via supplier scorecard for: quality, price, delivery, survey
    Lost discount monitoring - measurement of lost early payment discount to suppliers for payment terms
    Create alerts or reporting procedures to monitor old PO's which have not been fully closed because lines on the PO remain open
    Perform allocations in purchasing and not in the ledger, for purchased goods if needed.
        Otherwise, interfaces to Projects and Payables will carry incorrect accrual codes
    Clean up supplier records during data conversion and not afterwards
        Oracle restricts what can be deleted and old upper case text will continue to appear on purchasing documents unless otherwise cleaned up
    Responsibilities should be built to separate requisitioning, purchasing, receiving and payment activities to different people to maintain oversight
    Make all purchases on purchase order and enforce pay only on purchase order rules/policies, to stamp out non-PO and renegade purchasing practices

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Responsibilities:
    PURCHASING SUPER USER (PSU)

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Profile Options:
    PO: Automatic Document Sourcing - to allow automatic generation of purchase orders from requisitions and the most recent blanket purchase agreement
    PO: Allow Autocreation of Oracle Sourcing Docments = "Yes" - to allow creation of Sourcing RFQ's from the core 'Autocreate' function in requisitions
    POR: Goods Line Type - establishes the default line type on a purchase order
    PO: Change Supplier Site - allows changes to a purchase order to include supplier site
    PO: Enforce Buyer - prevents a change to the buyer if set to yes, by forcing the buyer to be the user preparing the purchase order

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    Purchasing functions include: sourcing, requisitioning, purchasing and receiving and the system supports mainly operational decision-making
    Purchasing covers all goods and services: raw materials, capital equipment and fixed assets, expendable supplier (MRO), services.
    The destination type of an item (shop floor, inventory or expense) drives the default accounting treatment on the purchase order shipment/distribution lines
    Purchasing stores
        purchase orders,
        requisitions,
        supplier items and prices, and
        approval hierarchies for workflow approvals
    Most accounting information is derived by Account Generator
        based on the identity of the requestor and the nature of items ordered
    Complex purchases of services from a supplier may require implementation of Oracle Projects
    Part number cross references can be used to capture supplier part numbers and distributor part numbers
        as well as track legacy system part numbers for converted data
    Drop ship is supported, but the drop ship order originates in Order Management, and generates a purchase order in Purchasing.
    ASN's can be sent to customers based on notification from the supplier of a shipment
    Supplier acceptances are notifications from the supplier that they have accepted the PO and the delivery dates. These are also PO acknowledgments or PO-ack's.
    Purchasing provides Oracle Projects with cost updates for project/task/expenditure type as goods are requested, purchased and received and invoiced.
    Accruals for goods received but not purchased are not sent to projects at month end for the close process - a custom interface is required.
    Purchasing periods must be opened before accounting transactions can be created such as purchase accruals
    Exercise: Enter a release for a blanket PO -> PSU/Purchase Orders/Release, and specify the blanket PO to release against. Specify the shipping information.
    Exercise: Open Purchasing Periods -> Setup/Financials/Accounting/Control Purchasing Periods

        You cannot cancel a purchase order in 'In Process' or 'Pre-Approved'
        Cancel a PO from the PO menu: Actions > Control > Cancel
        You can control PO status with different actions: Cancel, Final Close, Close for Receiving, Close for Invoicing, Delete, Freeze, Hold, Firm
        Tip -> change document status through the tools menu on the PO form (don't open the PO, just inquire/search for return results, then use Tools/Control)
        Exercise: Cancel a purchase order -> PSU/Purchase Orders/Purchase Order Summary/Find Purchase Orders.. and find the purchase order to cancel, then choose Menu/Control to cancel.
        You can cancel an existing commitment to a supplier by cancelling a PO header, line, shipment or distribution
        By cancelling a PO or component of a PO, you cannot receive or match an invoice for payment against the cancelled component (header, line, shipment, distribution)
        Cancelling a component also cancels the components beneath that level: eg canceling a shipment line cancels all the distribution lines in the shipment.
        Documents that are cancelled at the header level can be purged. If encumbrance and budgetary accounting are used, the encumbrances for the cancelled commitments are reversed.
    Mass Cancel Purchase Orders
        Mass cancel allows canceling of groups of requisitions or purchase orders that are still active
        Mass cancel is in two steps: identify candidate PO's and Requ's to cancel, and then cancel them
        Creating a batch for mass cancellation creates a report of qualified candidates which are different for requisitions vs PO's
        Mass cancellation candidates for requisitions automatically excludes: requ's with PO's created, incomplete requ's, final closed requ's and cancelled requisitions.
        It only cancels requisitions that are approved, pre-approved, returned or returned
            A pre-approved requisition is one that is approved and forwarded for additional approval
            This is normally done by the final approver
        Exercise: Identify Mass cancel requisitions or purchase orders -> PSU/Accounting/Mass Cancel,
            and cancel for a specific supplier (PO's only) and for a range of account values, to produce a report of candidate requs and PO's
        Exercise: Mass Cancel requisitions or purchase orders -> PSU/Accounting/Run MassCancel, and specify the requ's and po's to cancel.
    Cancelling Requisitions
        Requisitions can be cancelled or closed to prevent them being placed on a purchase order
        Requisitions cannot be cancelled though Tools/Controls/Cancel Requisitions if there is an open purchase order against the requistion - cancel the PO first.
        The default Location on a requisition is taken from the Location on the requester's employee assignment record
        If PO's are canceled, their backing requisitions can also be canceled automatically. ***

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Open Interfaces:
    Requisitions Open Interface is for requisition import
        It can be scheduled to run continuously to bring in requisitions from other applications
        (e.g. OSP Requisitions from WIP)
        Uses the Requisitions Open Interface
            The Requisitions Open Interface does not assign account distributions using account generator
            It expects the distributions to be on the incoming requisition records
    Purchase Documents Open Interface is used for importing purchase orders

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Integration with Payables:
    Purchasing shares tables for suppliers and supplier sites to provide much of the default information
    Defaulted information from supplies and sites includes: payments, terms and payment methods. These can be overriddeon on purchasing documents and invoices
    Matching levels are enforced in Payables: two way, three way and four way matching.
    Invoice matching tolerances are defined on the Invoice Tolerance form for: qty ordered, qty received, price tolerance - all as a percentage
    Pay on receipt generates payments to suppliers based on items received and based on ASN and ASBN transactions. Invoices are created in Purchasing and sent to Payables
    Budgetary contol ties PO encumbrance amounts and approved invoice amounts to available budgets in the GL. Matching PO's and invoices transfers the encumbrance from PO's to invoices
    Payables reverses purchase receipt accruals of purchases booked to the ledger when the corresponding invoice is approved for payment

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Purchasing Setups:
    Ownership of supplier setup should be established in either AP or PO but not both
        This will help avoid double entry of suppliers
    A find should be conducted before entering a supplier
        This will identify if the supplier is already setup in the system
    There should be a document defining supplier naming conventions for all supplier setups to help ensure consistancy
    For multi-org implementations, suppliers are shared across all operating units so duplicate supplier checking is important before entering a new supplier
    Many inventory setup forms are shared with purchasing to allow item setups
    Create a template for purchase items before setting up individual items - use the template to default purchasing item defaults
    Employees must be defined as buyer before they can create purchase orders
    Global buyers can be setup as buyers across multiple business groups. Set the HR: Cross Business Groups profile at the site level to 'Yes'
        The buyer name LOV becomes global instead of limiting the buyer LOV to the current business group. The find window displays the buyer and business group
    Line type establishes the default line data structure on requisitions and PO's: seeded values are goods, services, and outside processing
    Line type must be choose a value basis of either units times rate, or fixed amount. The unit in unit x rate can be any unit of measure. Line type sets defaults for units, value, category.
    Line type is established with the profile option POR: goods line type at the operating unit level
    Exercise: Setup buyers -> PSU/Setup/Personnel/Buyers, to enter a buyer and their default purchasing category and default ship-to address for purchases
    Exercise: Setup locations -> PSU/Setup/Organizations/Locations, to define ship-to and receiving locations for requisitions and purchase orders
    Exercise: Enter requisition preferences -> PSU/Requisitions/Requisitions, and choose Tools, Preferences from the menu.

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Order of Setups:

    UN Numbers - to define UN reference numbers for international trade. Hazard classes can be associated with UN numbers
    Standard Notes and Attachments - on requisitions, RFQ's, and purchase orders.
    Purchasing Item Category Flexfield by defining
        purchasing categories,
        value sets,
        flexfield segments,
        segment values and account aliases and account x-validation rules
    Buyers - to give privileges to create purchasing documents.
    Line Types - to distinguish items purchased by price and quantity, or by total amount. Line types have seeded values
    Transaction Managers - must be started, including the receiving transaction manager, and workflow transaction manager.
    Notification Process - by starting the 'send notifications of purchasing documents' workflow to notify users of incomplete documents
    Document Creation Options - in the PO Create Documents workflow. Options include automatic creation, creation of releases, and automatic approval
    Exercise: Setup hazard classes -> PSU/Setup/Purchasing/Hazard Classes
    Exercise: Setup UN numbers -> PSU/Setup/Purchasing/UN Numbers
    Exercise: Setup buyers -> PSU/Setup/Personnel, and associate an employee with a buyer designation and their allowable categories
    Exercise: Setup banks -> Payables/Setup/Payment/Banks

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Lookup Codes:
    Lookup codes are used throughout Purchasing to populate lists of values that drive processing within the applications (unlike data values in value sets)
    Lookup codes are categorized or grouped by lookup type and the allowable values for lookup types are the lookup codes
    Predefined lookup types include:
        1099 Supplier,
        Exception, Acceptance Type,
        FOB (free on board),
        Freight Terms,
        Minority Group,

        Price Type,
        Quotation Approval Reason,
        Reply/Receive Via, and
        Supplier Type.
    Exercise: Enter Lookup Codes -> PSU/Setup/Purchasing/Lookup Codes
        (also via -> System Administration/Lookup Codes)

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Quality Inspection Codes:
    Quality Inspection Codes are used to specify return reasons on inspected materials for returns.
    Quality Inspection Codes have rankings between 0 and 100, where 0 represents the lowest quality.
    Quality Inspection Codes can also define specific conditions, such as 'damaged goods' or excellent condition.
    Quality Inspection Codes are otherwise referred as Quality Codes
    Quality Codes are recorded on receiving inspections of goods and on return transactions (in the Receiving Returns window in the Details alternate region)
    Exercise: Enter Quality Inspection Codes -> PSU/Setup/Purchasing/Quality Inspection Codes, and enter return reason and inspection code values and rankings

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Financial Options:
    Financial Options include accounting, budgetary, control, encumbrance, payment, personnel, purchasing, VAT and supplier options
    Financial Options must be set up for each operating unit.
    There are seven alternate regions: accounting, encumbrance, HR, supplier-payables, supplier-purchasing, supplier entry and tax.
    Accounting options include the future open period limit and default accounts used in payables and purchasing
    Encumbrance options enable encumbrances on budgets for requisitions and purchase orders, and to enter encumbrance types
    HR options identify the business group, which approval hierarchies to use, and default AP mailing of expense checks (home or office), and employee numbering
    Supplier-Payables options defaults payment terms, payment method, receipt acceptance days, discount offer.
    Supplier-Purchasing options defaults the ship-to, bill-to, inventory org, FOB, carrier, and freight terms
    Supplier-Entry options default values when entering suppliers: RFQ only sites, hold options on unmatched invoices, and supplier numbering
    Tax options allow selection of a default tax name, enabling tax recovery, tax calculation rounding rules, and VAT registration number
    Exercise: Set financial options for purchasing -> PSU/Organizations/Financial Options, to choose set of books, default accounts, and other defaults.

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Purchasing (and Requisitioning) Options:
    Purchasing options establish defaults and controls for purchasing
    Purchasing option 'Receipt Close Tolerance' can be over-ridden at the item and PO shipment line level to enable or disable receiving
    If the 'Receipt Close Tolerance' is set to 100% then PO shipment lines are automatically closed to receiving when they are created
    Purchasing option 'Invoice Close Tolerance' can be overridden at the item and PO shipment line level.
    If the 'Invoice Close Tolerance' is set to 100% then the PO shipment lines are automatically closed to invoice matching when they are created
    Purchasing option 'Invoice Matching Level' can be overridden at the Inventory Organization, Supplier, Item and PO Shipment Line level
    Purchasing options has several alternate regions: accrual, control, default, internal, numbering and tax
    Accrual options include: rules for accruing expenses and inventory charges on receipt or at period end, and the default expense accrual account
    Control options include: defaults for price tolerances, full lot quantities, receipt close point (accepted, delivered, received point), cancelling requisitions, and security hierarchy,
    Control options also include:
        displaying messages,
        notification of blanket PO's,
        allowance of item description updates,
        enforcing buyer name, and
        enforcing vendor holds
    Price tolerance is the percent tolerance allowed between a requisition and a purchase order price
    The Cancel Requisitions option sets the rules for canceling requisition lines
        when a purchase order is cancelled
        Values are:
            never, optionally and always
    Enforce Vendor Hold determines if purchase orders can be approved if a vendor is put on hold
    'Enforce Buyer Name' is on the Control Alternate Region
        It enforces the buyer name to be the user's name on the PO entry form
    Default options on the Purchasing Options Default tab include:
        requisition import group,
        minimum release amount,
        price break type,
        quote warning delay,
        receipt close tolerance percent and
        invoice close percent

        set the default for internal order source
        in order entry for requisitions sourced from internal orders
    Numbering options are: manual or automatic, and numbering type (numeric or alphanumeric)
        Using these options you can automate or manually create:
            Purchase Order Numbers
            Requistions Numbers
            Quotation Numbers
            RFQ (Request for Quotation) Numbers
    Tax options set the order in which tax names are defaulted onto purchasing documents
    Exercise: Set purchasing options
        -> Purchasing Super User/Setup/Organizations/Purchasing Options
            to set purchasing and requisitioning options
    Exercise: Define line types
        -> Purchasing Super User/Setup/Purchasing/Line Types

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Receiving Options:
    Several receiving options are contained on the purchasing options forms, especially receipt close tolerances.
        See purchasing options for more information
    Most receiving options can be overridden for specific suppliers, items and purchase orders.
    Options include:
        receipt days
        over-receipt tolerance
        receipt numbering
        substitution rules

    Additional options include:
        allow cascade receipts
        allow blind receiving
        receipt routing
        enforcing ship-to
        ASN control code
        and receipt accrual account
Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Receiving Options:
    Exercise: set receiving options -> Purchasing Superuser/Setup/Organizations/Receiving Options, to set options for receipt numbering, data ranges, overreceipt limits and misc controls

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Locations:
    Locations are setup for ship-to, bill-to, receiving and other location info for purchasing documents
        This includes "deliver-to" for iProcurement)
    Receiving locations are temporary receiving areas for intermediate storage of goods
        they are primarily for inspection before being stored or used
    Receiving locations are not used if the routing is direct receipt.
        They apply to standard receipt routing which involves inspections
    Locations have three alternate regions: address, ship-to and other.
        The Address alternate region incudes address style.
        Address style must be defined before an address can be entered
    The Shipping alternate region includes contact name, ship-to equivalent location, and allowable activities checkboxes
        The Other Details alternate region includes inventory org, EDI location, and default site tax code/name
    The tax code in the other details region is used for tax calculation if the tax hierarchy points to ship-to location for tax values
    Deliver-To locations can be entered as 'one-time' addresses in iProcurement
    Exercise: Create locations -> PSU/Setup/Organizations/Locations

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Suppliers:
    In R12, Suppliers are stored in AP.AP_SUPPLIERS
    Each supplier can have multiple sites (and each site is assigned an address and activities)
        Each site can have multiple supplier contacts
    Defaults are setup at supplier and supplier site level and can be overridden on requisitions, PO's and invoices
    Alternate regions at the supplier level are: General, Classification, Accounting, Control, Bank Accounts, EDI, Invoice Tax, Withholding Tax, Tax Reporting, Purchasing, Receiving
    Most information defaults to the supplier site alternate regions based on information at the supplier level, but can be over-ridden at the supplier site level
    The supplier tables and supplier entry forms are shared with Accounts Payable and can be setup in either place. Ownership should be established in either place
    Suppliers are automatically assigned numbers when the new supplier is first saved, if the AutoNumber option is set in Financial Options - Supplier Entry Tab
    Suppliers are shared across organizations in a multi-org environment so duplicate supplier checks should be run before entering a new supplier
    Header Region -> tax Registration Number is for supplier companies, Taxpay ID is for individuals who are suppliers
    Header Region -> the taxpayer ID for individuals and employees is always their social security number
    Header Region -> entering an 'inactive date' will end-date a supplier and stop invoices and purchase orders being assigned to the supplier after a specified date
    General Region -> Parent suppliers can receive payment for suppliers' invoices
    General Region -> holds the parent supplier, and the customer number used by the supplier to reference your company
    Classification Region -> is for reference information only, except for employee name. If the type is entered as 'Employee' an employee name can be entered
    Classification Region -> the classifications for Supplier Type and Minority code are established using Lookup Codes
    Classification Region -> employees are linked to their supplier records by entering employee after setting the Supplier Type = 'Employee'
    Classification Region -> the 'one time' check box on the Classification region is for reference only, to indicate it is not expected to do any future business with this supplier
    Accounting Region -> establishes default accounts for: expense/capital distribution, liability (ap), prepayment and future dated payment
    Accounting Region -> values are defaulted from the Financial Options - Accounting Alternate Region, for the organization
    Accounting Region -> Is not enterable (greyed out) if Multi-org is turned on. These accounts must be entered at the site level.
    Control Region -> identifies the matching method (PO 2 way or receipt 3 way), invoice amount limit, and holds for unmatched, unvalidated or all invoices, plus a hold reason
    Control Region -> the invoice amount limit is the maximum per invoice. Invoices exceeding this amount will be put on hold
    Control Region -> the matching method is defaulted from the Financials Options for the organization/operating unit
    Control Region -> 'Hold All Payments' prevents any invoices entered for a supplier or supplier site from being selected for payment processing in AP.
        All future invoices can be placed on hold by checking the 'hold all invoices' option
    Control Region -> 'Hold Unapproved Invoices' puts all invoices on hold as they are entered but allows existing approved invoices to be paid in AP
    Control Region -> 'Hold Unmatched Invoices' places a matching required hold on all unmatched invoices in AP
    Control Region -> Match holds in the control region should not be turned on for employees who are reimbursed expenses, or for direct pay suppliers who do not receive purchase orders
    Payment Terms Region -> is defaulted from the Payables Options values. These values specify payment terms and dates and payment vs invoice currency defaults
    Payment Terms Region -> apart from the standard default values, it is normal to check 'Exclude Freight from Discount'
    Payment Terms Region -> payment priority is between 1 and 99 with 99 being the lowest priority for payment
    Payment Terms Region -> paygroup is used by AP to group invoices for a single payment run. All invoices can be paid in batches by paygroup.
    Payment Terms Region -> the Pay Alone field enforces a separate payment for an invoice. The invoice is not grouped with other invoices on a single combined payment in AP
    Bank Accounts Region -> establishes the suppliers' bank account for electronic payments - bank details are setup separately in Setup/Banks and linked to the supplier
    Bank Accounts Region -> One of the bank accounts must be defined as the primary bank account for each supplier for each currency entered on the form, in order to save the bank account record
    EDI Region -> stores the electronic payment method and format, remittance method and special instructions
    EDI methods supported include: ACH (Automated Clearing House), BACS (Bank Automated Clearing System), SWT (Swift), FWT/FEW (Fed Wire Method 1 and 2).
    Invoice Tax Region -> sets the calculation level for automatic taxes on invoices, a default tax value for an invoice and an override allowed flag to override at invoice entry
    Withholding Tax Region -> turns on withholding tax for the vendor and associates a withholding tax group, such as 1099.
    Tax Reporting Region -> adds detail for 1099 reportable vendors only - along with filing classifications for the 1099 vendor
    Purchasing Region -> identifies the default ship-to and bill-to default locations, ship via, FOB and freight terms that defaults to the Supplier Sites
    Purchasing Region -> most of the region defaults are derived from the Purchasing Options and Financial Options values for the organization.
    Purchasing Region -> the Purchase Order Hold checkbox is used to put all future purchase orders on hold for this supplier, and allows a hold reason to be recorded
    Purchasing Region -> 'Create Debit Memo....' allows workflow to create a debit memo automatically for a return to supplier (RTS) entry
    Receiving Region -> records supplier level receiving options: receipt date tolerances, receipt routing, matching level and receipt amount tolerances, and allow substitute items and unordered items
    Receiving Region -> most of the values in the Receiving alternate region of supplier setup are defaulted from the 'Receiving Optons' values at the organization level and override those values if changed
    Receiving Region -> freight can be excluded from taking an early payment discount by choosing 'Exclude Freight from Discoun' in the Payments alternate region

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Supplier Sites:
    In R12 Supplier Sites are in AP_SUPPLIER_SITES
    Supplier sites are addresses where suppliers conduct their business
    Supplier sites are classified into three types based on site use: their 'site uses' can be RFQ only, purchasing (PO allowed), and pay (invoicing allowed) sites
    You can enter invoices and make payments to supplier 'pay' sites
    You can create purchase orders with supplier 'purchasing' sites
    You can create RFQ's with supplier 'RFQ' only sites but cannot create purchase orders or enter invoices referencing those sites.
        Their purpose is to solicit bids from potiential suppliers
    After accepting an RFQ from a supplier at an 'RFQ Only' site, it is possible to change the site type to allow purchase orders
    Supplier site names do not appear on purchasing documents and remain internal references to supplier locations.
        Site names must be unique in their uppercase equivalent values
    Supplier site alternate regions are similar to the supplier alternate regions except for two addtional regions:
        Site Uses (to distinguish what is allowed at the site) and Telephone and Contacts
    There is no supplier site alternate region for receiving options as their is at the supplier level
    Supplier alternate region information automatically defaults to the supplier site alternate region and can be overridden at the supplier site with new values
    The General alternate region for a supplier site records the use of the site (purchasing, payment, RFQ only) and general contact numbers
    Supplier sites must exist for 'purchasing' and 'payment' if PO's are to be issued and invoices paid for the supplier.
        Check 'Purchasing' and 'Payment' on the General alternate region of a supplier sites
    The supplier notification method (email, fax, printed document) is recorded in the General Alternate region
        Also recorded are the addresses, email addresses and fax numbers needed to send the notifications
    The Contacts alternate region for a supplier site records people and their contact and mailing information
    The Accounting alternate region for a supplier site records accounts and distribution sets for:
        expenses and inventory, liability, prepayment, and future dated payment
    The Control alternate region is the same at the supplier site level as the supplier level.
        It tracks matching level, invoice amount limit and holds for unmatched, unvalidated or all invoices
    The Payment Terms alternate region at the Supplier Site level is the same as the Supplier level.
        It tracks payment terms, discount trigger dates, payment methods and currencies
    The Bank Accounts alternate region at the Supplier Site level is the same as the Supplier level.
        It tracks bank accounts and currencies and payment methods for remittances
    The EDI alternate region is the same at the Supplier site level as the supplier level.
        It identifies the electronic payment method and format, remittance method and special instructions.
    The Invoice Tax alternate region sets the calculation level for automatic taxes on invoices
        It also has a default tax value for an invoice and an override allowed flag to override at invoice entry
    Supplier sites are enabled as income tax reporting sites for 1099 vendors if the option is set on the 'Tax Reporting' alternate region.
        This is required for 1099 vendors
    Exercise: Setup Suppliers (in AP) -> APSU/Supply Base/Suppliers/

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Supplier Merge:
    Merging suppliers allows multiple suppliers to be merged into one
        This eliminates duplicates or to consolidate suppliers after an acquisition
    You can copy an old supplier site to a new supplier, and the old site will be deactivated
    Merging suppliers automatically transfers PO's and invoices, PO's can be excluded from the invoice merge if desired
    You can choose to merge all, none or only unpaid invoices
    Supplier merge does not transfer RFQ's, supplier lists and sourcing rules.
        These must be inspected and transfered manually
    Duplicate vendors can be identified by running the Vendor Audit Report or the Vendors Report
    Exercise: Merge Suppliers (in PO) -> APSU/Supply Base/Supplier Merge

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Requests for Quotation:
    A request for quotation (RFQ) is a request for pricing and related information sent to a supplier
        The information received from the supplier is placed on the catalog as a quotation if approved
    There are four types of RFQ: bid, standard, catalog and Sourcing. RFQ Types are specified in the RFQ header
        Bid RFQ's are for specific items and delivery dates and specific quantities - they have specific shipment qtys and locations,
        Catalog RFQ's are for high volume items purchased over a period of time - they have different qty's w/price breaks.
        Standard RFQ are for specific items and specialty items that are not ordered over a period of time but may have price breaks depending on volumes actually purchased
        Sourcing RFQ's are completed in the Oracle Sourcing application
        The ability to create sourcing RFQ's is enabled by the profile option -> PO: Allow Autocreation of Oracle Sourcing Docments = "Yes"
    RFQ's can be created manually, or automatically from requisitions, including req's where the RFQ Required field is checked
    Suppliers and supplier sites must exist before creating an RFQ, either individually or as a Supplier List
    RFQ's created automatically from requisitions and can be created from selected lines on the requisition or from all lines
    You do not need a requisition to create an RFQ, but any requistion marked 'RFQ Required' must have an RFQ generated
    RFQ's can contain specifications, target prices, order quantity ranges, standard classifications, and proposed shipments
    RFQ ship-to location on the header defaults to the shipment lines but can be over-ridden for each shipment line
    RFQ statuses are: in process (initial status), Active (ready for approval or sent to suppliers), and Closed (past effective end date)
    RFQ's can only be printed if they are 'Active' status
    Catalog RFQ's allow price breaks to be requested from the supplier for quantity ranges, terms and ship-to locations.
    Price breaks are specific to an RFQ line
    RFQ's can generate catalog quotations and standard quotations by using the copy function from within the RFQ
        You must enter suppliers in order to enable the copy option from the RFQ form
    Exercise: Create RFQ manually -> PSU/RFQ's and Quotations/RFQ's
    Exercise: Create catalog quote or standard quote from RFQ -> PSU/RFQ's and Quotations/RFQ's (query for RFQ and use tools/copy function to create quotation)

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Catalog Quotations, Bid Quotations and Standard Quotations:
    A quotation is a suppliers response to an RFQ
    Catalog quotations are for large purchases with limits over fixed time periods, whereas standard quotations are for minor occasional purchases over extended time periods
    Standard quotations don't track volumes of purchases, although volume based price breaks are available
    Quotations can be entered manually or throught the 'Copy Document' function from a RFQ form (query the RFQ and use copy)
    Quotations can also be copied to a blanket purchase agreement using the copy function from the catalog quote
    For automatically copied quotes, open the RFQ and choose the menu option 'Special/Copy Document' to create the corresponding quote
    For manually entered quotes, the supplier and supplier site are used to automatically build an LOV for the RFQ number, if any exist
    Form: Catalog Quote -> catalog quotes should be named after  the suppliers who provide the quotes
    Exercise: Create a catalog quotation -> PSU/RFQ's and Quotations/Quotations
    Table: PO_HEADERS_ALL -> query with TYPE_LOOKUP_CODE = 'QUOTATION' to get quotation headers

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Quotation Analysis
    Exercise: Quotation Analysis -> Purchasing Superuser/

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on the Tax Hierarchy and Tax Calculation
    Tax codes can be defaulted from multiple places in user defined order: ship-to location, item, supplier, supplier site, financial options
    The hierarchy for checking for tax codes is established in the Purchasing Options window - tax defaults alternate region.
    You can override the defaulted tax code if the profile option 'Tax: Allow Override of Tax Codes" is set to 'Yes'
    Recoverable rates can be set for each tax code, and specify the amount of credit you can claim for a tax
    Any tax code set in the Purchase Order preferences window will override the defaulted tax code
        preferences are treated as overrides at the requisition and purchase order entry point
    In Financial Options, the tax options region allows selection of a default tax name, enabling tax recovery, tax calculation rounding rules, and VAT registration number
    Tax codes carry tax names and the default charge account for the tax
    Taxes default onto lines on requisitions, purchase orders and blanket purchase orders based on the hierarchy established in Purchasing Options
    The tax default hierarchy is a user defined ranking, that checks for a tax code in several places:
        ship-to location, item, supplier-site, supplier and financial options (financial options window)
    Exercise: Setup tax hierarchy order -> PURCHASING/..../Purchasing Options and click on the Tax Defaults tab to specify the order of the hierarchy
    Profile Option -> Tax: Allow Override of Tax Codes - allows override of defaulted tax codes on a requisition

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Budget Checking and Encumbrance Accounting
    Encumbrances work off requisitions, purchase orders and invoices and are independent of receiving.
    Requisitions create encumbrances when they are submitted, and these encumbrances are transfered to PO's when they are approved
    Requisition and PO encumbrance amounts post to the encumbrance segment in a GL account.
    The GL Date on a requisition defines the period the encumbrance is applied against the budget
    Encumbrance segments offset budget segments for funds checking
    Encumbrances are relieved automatically when invoices are received and matched to purchase orders
        Matching to PO's closes or reduces net PO amounts
    Exercise: Check budget funds before submitting a requisition
        -> Menu/Special/Check Funds (this menu item is active only if encumbrance accounting is turned on)

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Purchasing Accruals and Month-End (Period-End) Processing:
    Purchasing receipt accruals are created for goods that are received but not yet billed
        i.e. invoice not received
        It creates reversing accruals on the ledger
    Purchasing periods must be opened before accounting transactions can be created such as purchase accruals
    Purchasing accruals act independently of budgetary control since accruals are optional
        So purchasing accruals and reversals don't relieve encumbrances (PO matching does that)
    Accruals can be set separately for inventory vs expense items
        Inventory item accrual transactions are created upon receipt
        Expense item accrual transactions can be created upon receipt or at month end
            Accrual upon receipt created a heavy reconciliation load and should be avoided - use month end accruals instead
            The concurrent process 'Receipt Accrual - Period End Process' must be run at month end to create the accruals
    Exercise: Set accrual options for inventory and expense ->
        Purchasing Super User/Setup/Purchasing Options/Accrual Tab (or Receipt Accounting Section in R12)
    Exercise: Accrue uninvoiced receipts after closing PO at month end -> PSU/Concurrent Manager/Receipt Accruals - Period End

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Requisition Preferences
    Requisition preferences are used to default project, destination, sourcing, currency, acccounting, justification and requestor options on the requisition footer
    The accounting distribution on requisition preferences applies to expense destination type items only and overrides the account generator values
    Requisition preferences apply for the current session only.
    Requisition preferences can be set from the Tools menu when the requisition form is displayed, and overridden at the line level
    The GL Date on the req preferences form is only active if budget and encumbrance processing is active
    Exercise: Enter requisition preferences -> PSU/Requisitions/Requisitions, and choose Tools, Preferences from the menu.

Purchasing and Receiving (PO) Notes on Requisitions
    Requisitions are internal requests for purchase orders and can be manual or automatic
    Destination type on a requisition can be shop floor (outside processing), inventory (stock enabled) or expense (delivered to requester).
        If the destination type is Expense, the goods are delivered to the requester at the specified location
        If the destination type is 'Inventory' a subinventory delivery location can be specified.
    Requisition structures have three levels: header, line, and distribution. One line can be split to multiple distributions
    Each distribution line has multiple accounts: charge account, budget account, accrual account, and any project related information
    Manual requisitions can have a different requester and preparer and both the requester name and the preparer name are tracked on the requisition
    MRP and Inventory can generate requisitions automatically for manufacturing planning and inventory economic order quantity restocking
    Automatic requistions from MRP and Inventory are loaded through requistion import, as are non-Oracle system requisitions
    Requisition Type ('Source Type') on a requisition drives default sourcing
        inventory (internal - creates sales order) or purchase (external - creates purchase order)
    Requisition Type at the requisition header level is over-ridden by source at the line level - Source is shown in the detail for each requisition line
    Document Type drives approvals, since approval hierarchies can be different for different document types, as defined through approval groups
    Source can be Inventory or Purchase, or both and can be restricted to one or other choices by a profile option
    Internal requisitions from employees (ie for internal items inventoried or sold by the company) are routed to Order Management and the Order Import Open Interface for processing
    Internal requistions are processed as an internal sales order
    Purchasing creates one sales order for each requisition line that has a Source of inventory on the requisition.
    Internal requisitions are identified by specifying the requisition type as 'Internal Requisition' on the requisition header a Source of  'Inventory' on a requisition line
    Each line on a purchase requisition can be sourced internally or through a supplier purchase, regardless of the requisition type
    Requisition Type of internal (inventory) or supplier, can be overridden in the 'Source Type' on individual requisition lines
    The price on an internally sourced requisition line is the cost of goods on the corresponding inventory item record
    The line type on a requisition is defaulted from purchasing options
        Navigation: Purchasing Options/'default' alternate region (goods, services, outside processing are seeded values)
        Line type on a requisition dictates the available fields and method for calculating the line
            value based, item and price-based etc
    Item numbers do not need to be entered on requisitions for expense items (ie non-inventory).
    An item description is required for an expense item and defaults from the item number for an inventory item. It is a required field
    Unit of measure on a req line defaults from the item master for an inventory item
    The price on a requisition line will default from a sourcing rule if one exists,
        otherwise the price can be entered manually
    Supplier item numbers can be entered in the Sourcing alternate region of a requisition line
    The requisitioner can request sourcing on the sourcing alternate region as 'blanket' or 'quotation'
    If a buyer is not nominated on a requisition, the requisition goes to the req pool for buyer assignment before creating a PO
        The PO is subsequently created by the AutoCreate process to pick up requisitions from the requisition pool
    Exercise: Create a requisition -> PSU/Requistions/Requisitions and specify type as purchase or internal.
    Exercise: Assign a requisiton to a buyer to create a PO -> PSU/...../Assign Requisitions

Purchasing and Receiving (PO) Notes on Entering Requisitions:
    01. Open the Requistions window (Requisitions/Requisitions)
    02. Check the menu Tools/Preferences to setup requisition preferences for the session if needed
    02. Enter the description in the requisition header and tab out to default values for the first requisition line. Go to the Lines alternate region
    03. Agree or change the line type and fill out the line.
    04. Enter an item number for an inventory item or skip to the category for a non-inventory item. Use Category MISC.MISC for non inventory items
    04. Search the catalog for items if they are inventory items, using an open query to select all items for a supplier, or some other method
    04. Click on distribution and fillout the charge code (tab into the charge code field and it defaults from the expense category default or the item default)
    05. Check and accept the Destination Type (Expense or Inventory) and override the requestor name if needed.
    05. If not a sourced catalog item, enter the buyer name and site (if known) and a contact name and number - or leave for the buyer to source the item
    05. Click the Approval button and submit for approval (check the menu Tools/Funds Check if enabled to do funds checking first)
    06. Go to Requisitions Summary and query the requisition
        then check the menu inquire/action history to see the status of the requisition approval

Purchasing and Receiving (PO) Notes on Requisition Import:
    Requisition import does not use the Account Generator for purchasing, so dynamic insertion of new GL codes is not supported.

Purchasing and Receiving (PO) Notes on Setups for Internally Sourced Requisitions (Internal Sales Orders)
    Setup for internally sourced requisitions involved Order Entry, Inventory and Purchasing
    Order entry setups for internal sales orders include
        profile options
        order cycles
        order source numbers
        order import sources
        std value rule sets
        price lists
        order types
        concurrent programs
    Inventory setups for internal sales orders include
        internal items
        inter-org shipping networks
        item sourcing
        concurrent programs
    Purchasing setups for Internal Sales Orders include
        internal requisition deliver-to sites
        purchasing options
        concurrent programs
    Oracle converts requisitions with requisition line source of  'internal' into sales orders
        No PO is created
        This establishes a demand against inventory.
    Two processes are used to create orders
        Create Internal Sales Order process, and
        Order Import process
    The 'Create Internal Sales Order' process takes internally sourced requisitions
        and creates internal sales orders on the order import interface tables

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Automatically Generating PO's from Requisitions
    Purchasing documents can be auto-created from requisitions using AutoCreate fromt the purchasing menu
    They can also be autocreated without buyer intervention
    The profile option -> PO: Automatic Document Sourcing" must be set to "Yes"
        This will allow automatic generation of purchase orders from requisitions
    The Contract Agreement used for the purchase order is the blanket purchase agreement for the supplier
        Blanket Purchase Agreements in a status "Requires Reapproval" are not used or considered
        The Blanket Purchase Agreement must also not be closed, finally closed, canceled at the header or line level
        The Expiration Date on the Blanket Purchase Agreement cannot be less than the sourcing date
    ASL's and sourcing rules are not required if requisitions or purchase orders are built by selecting sourced items
        Either from the internal supplier catalog or iProcurement catalog which are already sourced
    Automatic sourcing means you don't have to reference the source document on the ASL line in the ASL line definition
        the system finds the most recent document for the supplier and item
        Set profile option :PO: Automatic Sourcing Document" to Yes to provide automatic sourcing (at the site level)
    Steps to setup automatic sourcing and generation of purchase orders:
        1. set the profile option "PO: Automatic Document Sourcing" to "Yes"
        2. In Oracle Workflow Builder, set the poxwfatc.wft attributes
            Is Automatic Creation Allowed? = 'Y'
            Is Automatic Approval Allowed? = 'Y'
            Should Contract Be Used to AutoCreate Doc? = 'Y'
            Should Non-Catalog Requests Be Autosourced from Contract = 'Y'
        3. In Oracle Workflow Builder, set the poxsfrqa.wft attributes
            Send PO Autocreation to Background = 'N'
        4. Create a Contract Purchase Agreement (i.e. blanket)
        A new standard purchase order will be created subject to the buyer's approval limits and CPA limits

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on the Supplier Item Catalog:
    The Supplier Item Catalog provides a simple method of finding items and their source information - which are catalog quotes and blanket PO's.
    Items from the Supplier Item Catalog can be added into a requisition or purchase order with sourcing information already defined
    The catalog is automatically updated when suppliers send catalog quotes in responses to RFQ's, and blanket purchase agreements
    The Purchasing Documents Open Interface is used to import:
        supplier items and prices into catalogs,
        blanket purchasing agreements,
        quotations,
        approved supplier lists and
        sourcing rules

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Requisition Templates:
    Requisition templates are lists of items to requisition and provide a shortcut to building a requisition by starting with the template or list
    Each line on a requisition template can be sourced or unsourced and reference a different supplier
    Requisition templates are imported into the unified catalog as separate priced/sourced or unpriced/unsourced catalog entries
    Requistion templates are used to streamline the requisitioning process - they can be setup once and changed at any time
    Once a requisition template is defined, it can be selected from the supplier item catalog by name and added to the requisition
    Once defined, a requisition template can be referenced in a supplier item catalog, or selected in loaded into iProcurement and selected from that catalog
    Requisitions templates limit requisitions to fewer items and sources to simplify the requisitioning process, used for commonly ordered items like office supplies
    Requisition templates include the quantity of each item to include in a requisition and purchase order
    Requisition templates are typed - they can be purchase requisition templates or inventory templates. However the line Source can override the header type
    Requisition template lines can include inventory and expense type items (ie different destination types). A description and UOM must be entered for expense destination items
    Requisition template lines can be built by copying the lines from an existing requisition or purchase order using the Copy button on the req template window
    When entering a requistion template line, choosing sourced items will default the supplier, supplier site, price and suggested buyer
        Each item on a requisition template can have a price that is different to the source price
    Choosing non-sourced items, you can enter the suggested buyer and suggested supplier/supplier site on the template
    Choosing non-sourced items, you can specify RFQ Required to force an RFQ on individual items in the template when they are added to a requisition
    Multiple base/source req's and PO's can be copied into a single requisition template - the lines add to the existing lines on the template
    Requisition templates are created from PO's and req's using a copy button on requisition template form
    Exercise: Define a requisition template -> PSU/Setup/Purchasing/Requisition Templates - click on each line to see the matching supplier detail on the bottom of the form

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Purchase Orders Preferences:
    Only employees defined as buyers can define PO preferences
    Ship to and bill to locations can be setup to default on purchase orders
    Orders can be defaulted as confirming orders by setting the confirming orders checkbox on, in the Purchasing Preferences form
    Exercise: Enter purchase order preferences -> PSU/Purchase Orders/Purchase Orders/Options/Preferences, and enter PO preferences for the session

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Building Standard Purchase Orders:
    Tip -> use auto-create to place requisitions from the requisition pool onto purchase orders (menu 'autocreate')
    Tip -> you can see a PO approval workflow from the menu option on the PO form
    Tip -> when entering a purchase order directly, be sure to enter the ship-to at the header level or the PO will not complete
    Tip -> if you specify an inventory item there is a restriction on the inventory organzations and ship-to's you can place on the order
        The inventory item must be in the inventory master for the inventory organizations for the org to appear on list of values
    Standard Purchase Orders (PO's) are one-time commitments to buy specific listed items from a supplier.
    Purchase Order structure is header (top), line (second), shipment (third), distribution (fourth).
    The Distributions alternate region carries details of how the items are distributed once they are received, including internal accounting
    One PO can have many lines, each line can have many shipments and each shipment can have many account distributions
    A single line on a requisition can have multiple lines with different suppliers on separate purchase orders
    Shipment lines define where items are to be shipped/delivered and distribution lines define the deliver-to locations and end-use accounting
    Entering a Standard Purchase Order requires specifying shipments and distribution lines based on those shipments which identify the inventory or expense account charged
    The default ship-to on a purchase order is taken from the default ship-to on the supplier site - it is only a default
        The actual ship-to location is on the shipment line
    There are several alternate regions on the PO Entry form for line detail: Items, Pricing, Reference Docs, and Shipments
    PO numbers can be automatically or manually assigned - as specified in the purchasing options form, alternate region 'numbering'
    PO statuses are: Incomplete (PO being created), Approved, Requires Reapproval (modifed after approval), and In Process (PO has been forwarded for approval)
    If you delete a PO the requisitions assigned to the PO are returned to the requisition pool for re-creation using AutoCreate
    The currency on a PO is defaulted from the functional currency on the set of books tied to the operating unit
    Currency is changed through the currency action button on the PO form, and allows a conversion/exchange rate to be entered
    Defaulted terms are modified by the terms action button on the PO form and allow changes to payment terms, freight terms, title transfer point
    Terms also allow recording of confirming order, firm order, require PO acceptance, acceptance date, supplier note and receiver note
    PO's tagged as confirming orders print a warning on the PO "This is a confirming order - do not duplicate' to prevent suppliers entering the order as a duplicate of a previous verbal order
    Service items are entered with a quantity of one and a unit price equal to the service price
    The pricing alternate region on a PO is used to enter additional pricing comparisons for analysis on the 'Savings Analysis Report' and to limit price changes on releases
    Additional prices include List Price, Market Price, and Price Type (which is a lookup code with seeded values: cost plus fee, cost plus percent, fixed, index, and variable)
    Pricing controls for releases (planned releases and blanket releases) include 'allow override' to allow a higher release price, a release price upper limit, and a flag to indicate a negotiated price on the PO
    The reference documents alternate regions shows the supplier quotation number and line number if a quotation was chosed from the supplier item catalog to create the PO line
    You can enter a contract agreement number to reference a supplier contract agreement.  The item total is added to the cumulative total for the contract agreement
    Only contract agreements for a supplier matching the PO header supplier can be added to the reference documents alternate region
    The 'more' region records the UNSPSC number, hazard class, transaction nature (lookup), and any attachments
    An item is checked as a capital item on the 'more' alternate region so it is created as an asset through the mass additions process in fixed assetsf
    The 'shipments' region allows multiple shipments for a single PO line. Click on the Shipments button on the PO to display all shipments for a single PO line
    The shipments region holds the ship-to, shipment line quantity, override promise date, need-by date (required for planned purchase orders), and over-ride tax code
    Receiving controls can be specified on the shipment lines (receiving controls button) for tolerances on quantities, dates and delivery location
    The 'distributions' region holds the account distribution and destination details (destination type, inventory and sub-inventory, deliver-to) of a shipment.
    The 'more' region within the distributions region holds requisition details
    Exercise: Enter a standard PO -> PSU/Purchase Orders/Purchase Orders, and choose Type = 'Standard PO', enter the shipment/distribution information before requesting approvals (the item drives the accounting defaults as an expense item or inventory item)

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Document Controls
    You can control PO status with different actions: Cancel, Final Close, Close for Receiving, Close for Invoicing, Delete, Freeze, Hold, Firm
    Tip -> change document status through the tools menu on the PO form (don't open the PO, just inquire/search for return results, then use Tools/Control)
    Exercise: Cancel a purchase order -> PSU/Purchase Orders/Purchase Order Summary/Find Purchase Orders.. and find the purchase order to cancel, then choose Menu/Control to cancel.

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Carriers on Purchase Orders
    Carriers can be specified on purchase orderes at the PO header level on the terms and conditions dialog
    Carrier information includes: freight terms, carrier (carrier name or carrier method such as rail) and FOB (origin or destination)
    Freight terms and FOB are defined as lookup types in the purchasing lookup types definitions
    The relationship between carriers and shipment methods can be established for each operating unit in the purchasing form 'Carrier-Ship Method Relationships'
    The default carrier, title transfer point and freight terms can be setup for suppliers using the purchasing options on the supplier definition form.
    Carriers can be defined for RFQ's at the header and line levels also, to form part of the RFQ terms and conditions

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Purchase Order Changes:
    PO revision numbers are generated if PO's are changed after they are approved and printed
    Suppliers cannot be changed on approved PO's - the PO must be cancelled and a new PO issued
    The supplier site on a PO can be changed if the profile option PO: Change Supplier Site, is set to yes
    The buyer name can be changed if the purchasing option 'enforce buyer name' is 'no' on the control region of the purchasing options form
    Units of measure on PO lines can be changed until the line is received or billed
        For almost any fields that are changed on an approved purchase order, the PO status will be changed to 'Requires Reapproval' when the changes are saved

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Purchase Order Statuses and Controls
    You can cancel an existing commitment to a supplier by cancelling a PO header, line, shipment or distribution
    By cancelling a PO or component of a PO, you cannot receive or match an invoice for payment against the cancelled component (header, line, shipment, distribution)
    Cancelling a component also cancels the components beneath that level: eg canceling a shipment line cancels all the distribution lines in the shipment.
    Documents that are cancelled at the header level can be purged. If encumbrance and budgetary accounting are used, the encumbrances for the cancelled commitments are reversed.
    Purchasing automatically closes shipments for receiving and invoice matching based on the close tolerances specified in the purchasing options window
    Once all shipments for a given purchasing line are closed, purchasing automatically closes the line
    When all lines for a given document are closed, purchasing automatically closes the document
    Purchase orders at the shipment level can be closed for invoicing, closed for receiving or closed
    You can close or reopen documents and their components for invoicing and receiving using the Control Documents window
    The Close for Invoicing status does not prevent matching an invoice to a receipt or a purchase order in the future
    Exercise: Examine and modify PO statuses at the header and line level in the Control Documents window -> PSU/Purchase Order Summary/(find)/ then menu/tools/controls - also available at the PO line level in the same form

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Purchase Order Approvals:
    The approval hierarchy can be changed in the core applications in the approval window but cannot be changed in iProcurement
                The approval dialog in core purchasing for purchase orders allows standard approval or forwarding to another person for approval
    Exercise: Select and approve existing purchase orders -> PSU/Purchase Orders/Purchasing Summary, and select purchase orders by status to submit for approval

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Building Accounts with Account Generator for Shipment Lines on Purchase Orders:
    Account Generator is used to build accounts on PO shipment lines for purchase orders, releases and requisitions
    Account Generator builds four accounts: purchasing charge, purchasing accrual, budget encumbrance and purchasing price variance.
    Account Generator uses the Destination Type of Expense, Inventory or Shop Floor to look up accounts from different default account sources
    Account Generator copies the charge account from the requisition to the purchase order if the account exists (and the PO is built on a requisition)
    Otherwise Account Generator builds the accounts for each shipment line based on destination type for each shipment
    For expense destination types, AG copies the expense account default from the item master
    If an item master does not exist, the expense account is defaulted from the requisitioner default expense account which is on the requisition
    The account generator for expenses accounting overrides segments with expense account charge rules entered through the Procure-to-Pay responsibility.
    Profile Option -> "Flexfields:Validate on Server" must be set to "No" to enable rules to be added to the expense account charge rules form
    For inventoried expense destination types, the AG copies the expense code from the subinventory default first, and looks at the item expense default second. It looks at the inventory organization parameters third
    For inventoried asset destination types, the AG copies the asset account from the subinventory default, and secondly from the org parameters asset account default.
    For shop floor destination, the AG looks at (in order): material, material overhead, resource, outside processing and overhead default accounts
    Profile Options: 'Account Generator:Run in Debug Mode' and 'PO:Set Debug Workflow On' - provides debug information on account generator issues.  Allows generation of a wfstat file for account generator.
    Account Generator has the option to allow dynamic insertion of new account codes when building account combinations

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Autocreating Standard PO's, Planned PO's, Blanket Releases and RFQ's from Requisitions:
    Buyers can use AutoCreate to generate different types of purchase orders from requisitions - by querying all requisitions where they are assigned as buyer
    Buyers can create standard purchase orders, RFQ's and Blanket Purchase Agreements through Autocreate
    Buyers can also create Sourcing RFQ's and Buyer Auctions from the Autocreate dialog
    Buyers can add to existing purchase orders, or create new purchase orders.
        If 'add-to' is chosen the system prompts for a purchase order number to extend.
    The location on the Auto-Create page defaults from the buyer definition - to pool/select requisitions for a specific ship-to
    In AutoCreate, the default category and ship to assigned to the buyer record defaults to the autocreated purchase orders
    Requisitions marked urgent can be autocreated on an expedited basis, separate from the bulk of requisitions - this is set in Requisition Preferences under the options menu
    Autocreate does not set the Terms on a purchase order to 'Acceptance Required' in the Terms form
    Edit the original requisiton when creating a PO in the "Modify Lines" dialog, by copying down the existing requisition lines onto new lines which automatically replaces the original lines
        If the profile option "PO: Restrict Requisition Line Modify to Quantity Split" enforces the same total item count on the new lines as existed on the original requisition line
    Autocreate in manual mode also allows the buyer to change the suggested supplier on the requistion - auto mode uses the suggested supplier on the requistion as the PO supplier
    Autocreate groups all requisition lines onto a PO having the same:
        item,
        item revision,
        line type,
        transaction reason and
        supplier item number
    Use Ctrl-Clk to highlight individual requistion lines to autocrate and click Auto to generate the purchase order
    Exercise: Autocreate a PO -> PSU/Autocreate, and find all requisitions that have a buyer name assigned (or blank the buyer name to retrieve all requ's)
    Exercise: Autocreate a PO from a Requisition -> PSU/Autocreate, click Find to view requisitions and check/select, then click 'Automatic' to create
    Exercise: Modify requisition lines when creating a PO: Purchasing Superuser/Autocreate/click Find using ReqNum (Clear Default Buyer), Display Req Lines/Tools/Modify and copy down requisition lines

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Blanket Purchasing Agreements:
    Purchase agreements can be blanket or contract types.
        Blanket purchasing agreements stipulate items, amounts and date ranges but not details of actual purchase order shipment
    Blanket agreements are used with individual releases and are appropriate if specific deliveries are not decided (ie may be triggered by an MRP system)
    Blanket agreements create sources for future purchase shipments by agreeing a price for items in advance.
    The supplier site can only be changed on a blanket purchase agreement if the profile option: PO: Change Supplier Site is set to Yes
    The ship-to and bill-to fields default from the supplier site, supplier and financial options default values respectively
    Blanket agreement terms specify payment and freight terms, limits on total value and minimum release values and effective date ranges
    Changing the Amount Limit on the financial terms does not update the Agreed Amount on the agreement header
    The currency window allows setting a different currency for the purchase agreement but valid exchange rates must be setup in advance
    If an item is not chosen for a blanket line, then a category is required for the typed in purchase description.
        The description must be added manually
    The price entered on the item line is a separate price to the list price and market price entered on the price reference region
    The Allow Price Override and Price Limit values on the Price Referency region allow a limit on prices where the release price exceeds the agreement price.
    In the Reference Documents region, you can't enter a contract agreeement number because this blanket agreement should be on it's own negotiated pricing
    If an item is chosen from a catalog quotation, the quotation details will display on the Reference Documents line.
        Blankets can be based on catalog quotations
    In the More region, UN numbers are exclusively for hazardous materials and don't relate to UNSPSC code values.
    The agreement section specifies the amount (volume and value) that can be released at any time and the pricing rule for price breaks
    If the pricing rule for price breaks is set to cumulative, then the pricing is based on the cumulative amount released to date and the amount of the current release
    The Price Break region specifies the discount for every quantity purchased within a quantity band. The quantity rule can apply to an individual release or cumulative releasess
    Exercise: Create a blanket purchase agreement -> PSU/Purchase Orders/Purchase Orders/.. .and choose type = 'Blanket Purchase Agreement'

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Supplier Lists
    Supplier Lists (SL's) can shorten the effort to issue RFQ's: SL's list the suppliers who will receive an RFQ if they are attached to the RFQ when it is defined
    Supplier Lists can be constructed to include competing suppliers for a single group of items purchased under the same agreement.
    Supplier Lists consist of suppliers and supplier sites, and optionally a contact name at each site for each supplier
    SL's can carry supplier and manufacturer part numbers as well as information about suppliers who are barred from supplying specific items
    Exercise: Create Supplier List: PSU/Supply Base/Supplier Lists, to create supplier lists for RFQ's
    Exercise: Attach a Supplier List to an RFQ: Purchasing Super User/RFQ's and Quotations/RFQ's.... create an RFQ "in progress" and click suppliers to attach an existing list

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Contract Purchase Agreements:
    Purchase Order Contracts and Blanket Agreements Overview (Doc ID 215784.1)
    Contract agreements give global buying authority with a supplier and do not require specific items or prices to be specified.
    Contract agreements are used with individual requisitions to create standard purchase orders
    Contract Purchase Agreements have general terms and require quotations, and subsequent PO's referencing the contract and the quote.
    Contract Purchase Agreements are used when the details of the items and prices are not known at the time of the contract
    RFQ's are issued under Contract Purchase Agreements where suppliers are prequalified and an approved and awarded quotations seals the final purchase.
    Subsequent standard purchase orders on Contract Purchase Agreements reference the quote and the contract purchase agreement
    The Create Documents workflow searches for Contract Purchase Agreements matching supplier sites on the requisition and places the requisition lines on a PO
    The PO references the Contract Purchase Agreement as the source document
    The workflow attribute CONTRACT_ID must be set to 'Yes' to enable contract purchasing agreement assignment
    Exercise: Enter contract purchase agreement -> PSU/Purchase Orders/Purchase Orders

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Blanket Purchase Agreements and Releases:
    Purchase Agreements can be Blanket Purchase Orders (term agreements for specific items with multiple releases)
    Blanket PO's are used by MRP to source requisitions
        Sourcing to a blanket PO is achieved through Sourcing Rules and Approved Supplier Lists
    Blanket Purchase Agreements define the items to buy but not the quantities or dates of delivery. They are shipped by blanket releases.
    Blanket PO's are entered without shipping information, which is required on Standard PO's. The shipping information is entered on the subsequent PO release.
    Requistions can be automatically sourced against blanket PO's (or catalog quotations)
    The supplier cannot be changed on an approved blanket purchasing agreement - the agreement must be cancelled and reentered
    The supplier site can be changed on a blanket purchasing agreement if the profile option PO: Change Supplier Site is set to Yes.
        However a revision number is incremented and reapproval is required.
    The ship-to and bill-to on a blanket PO header default from the financial options, or from the supplier values if a supplier is entered
    The buyer defaults from the user id if the user is defined as a buyer. Otherwise it remains blank
    The concurrent process Autorelease' must be run to create releases from requisitions
    Exercise: Enter a blanket PO -> PSU/Purchase Orders/Purchase Orders, and choose Type = 'Blanket PO',
        specify terms using the 'Terms' button, as well as price breaks

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Planned Purchase Orders and Scheduled Releases:
    Planned Purchase Orders are term agreements with listed items and accounting but no quantities
    Planned Purchase Orders have nominal dates for shipment but require releases to actuate.
    Planned Purchase Orders allow encumbering of budget accounts without issuing an actual purchase order - they have planned deliveries that blankets do not

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Sourcing with Approved Supplier Lists and Sourcing Rules
    Approved supplier lists are used in conjunction with sourcing rules to provide source information for an item, making sourcing a two stage process
    Sourcing rules default suppliers and supplier sites onto requisitions and PO's
        They determine the percentages of items that are sourced from different suppliers.
        They do not source the actual contract source document
            This is done through the Approved Supplier List (ASL) as a second step once the suppliers for the PO's are determined in the sourcing rules.
        Therefore sourcing rules are not considered 'approved' suppliers
         Because they do not require a source document to be set up when the sourcing rule is defined.
    Care must be taken in defining sourcing rules and ASL's to use the same org (or use 'global') as will be used on the requisitions.
    ASL's maintain lists of suppliers and items and valid source documents
        They are not used to automatically source a requisition line or purchase order
        A Sourcing Rule is required for that
    A Sourcing Rule is a named list of suppliers and supplier sites with effective dates.
        A sourcing rule is attached by an Assignment Set to a list of items
        The assignment set name must be set in the profile option MRP: Default Sourcing Assignment Set in order for it to be used for sourcing rules
            Purchasing uses only one assignment set for purchase sourcing and this is the one (planning can use multiple sets)
        The assignment set does not allow duplicate (ie overlapping or same organization, item and source type) assignment rules
    If a sourcing rule is made global (ie all orgs is checked) then it will appear on the assignment list for an item - type assignment, otherwise use item-organization as the assignment type
    The item uses the assignment set line to default the supplier and supplier site
        The Approved Supplier List finds a source purchasing document
            This is based on a matching supplier and item
    Sourcing rules allow multiple suppliers for an item
        The supplier with the highest rank is chosen as the source for a requisition line
    Create a Sourcing Rule and attach it to an item in an Assignment Set - this establishes a link between the item and a supplier
    The approved Supplier List uses the defaulted supplier and item to find a source document
        (a blanket agreement or catalog quotation)
    If 'Use Approved Supplier' is checked on the item in the requisition or purchase order ...
        an ASL entry must exist for the supplier on the sourcing rule or the supplier will not be used
    The linkage for sourcing becomes: Item -> Assignment Set -> Sourcing Rule (Supplier) -> Sourcing Rule -> Source Document (based on the item match)
    ASL's are not source documents but link quotes and blanket agreement source documents to requisition lines if an item and supplier are specified
        ASL's imported into iProcurement create a catalog item for each combination of item and approved supplier using the current quote price in core
    Sourcing rules require MRP setups and MRP uses sourcing rules to source supplier quotations or blanket PO lines to MRP requisitions
    ASL's and sourcing rules are not required if requisitions or purchase orders are built by selecting sourced items
        Either from the internal supplier catalog or iProcurement catalog which are already sourced
    You can specify a sourcing rule without specifying an ASL if you want to assign a supplier to a requisiton line.
        However you need to specify an ASL to source to the document level
    Automatic sourcing means you don't have to reference the source document on the ASL line in the ASL line definition
        the system finds the most recent document for the supplier and item
        Set profile option :PO: Automatic Sourcing Document" to Yes to provide automatic sourcing (at the site level)
    If you don't use automatic sourcing, you must specify the source document (blanket or quote) on the ASL line so Oracle can find the document
    Sourcing rules will source a requisition item to a supplier (and source document if there is an ASL setup) (catalog quotation or blanket purchase order)
    Sourcing rules actively place a source supplier and purchasing document on a requisition line or purchase order line as you enter the item
    If sourcing rules are not assigned to items, those items cannot be sourced to suppliers.
        Planned orders will not be generated for items without active sourcing rules
    Approved supplier lists will source a requisition item-and-supplier to an approved source document (such as a catalog quote or blanket PO)
    Sourcing Rules use the Sourcing Rule and SR/BOD Assignments windows to define supplier sources for items
    ASL's use the Approved Supplier List and Supplier-Item Attributes window to source items to a specific supplier and approved source document (blanket PO or quote)
    Requisitions sourced to a catalog quote become a purchase order, and requisitions sourced to a blanket PO become a release
        (unless there is a global agreement aka global blanket that will create PO's)
    Sourcing using both ASL's and Sourcing rules is first attempted at the item level, and then category level rules are checked
    Sourcing rules take precedence over Approved Supplier Lists
    Form: Sourcing Rules -> the Sourcing rule should be named the same as the commodities it is used to source.
    Form: Sourcing Rules -> 'planning active' means the total sourcing rule allocation percent totals 100% and it can be used to source planning orders
    Form: Sourcing Rules -> 'rank' on a sourcing rule lines breaks the tie between two lines with the same allocation percentage.
        The higher rank is allocated purchase orders first
    Form: Sourcing Rule Assignment -> 'Assigned To' can be 'item-organization' if the sourcing rule is defined for all organizations or the item is in the sourcing rule's organization
    Form: Approved Supplier List -> can handle supplier quotation lines for multiple items. Each new item in the top half of the form refreshes the bottom half of the form to make new blank entries
    Form: Approved Supplier List -> you can have multiple items in the top half of the form and one item in the bottom half to point multiple items to a single source quotation
    Form: Approved Supplier List -> when you enter the supplier for an item, the valid catalog quotation numbers are automatically searched and found to add as a valid source
    Exercise: Create sourcing rules -> PSU/Supply Base/Sourcing Rules/...
    Exercise: Assign sourcing rules -> PSU/Supply Base/Assign Sourcing Rules/....
    Exercise: Create approved supplier lists - PSU/Supply Base/Approved Supplier List

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Multiple Foreign Currencies:
    If 'Use Multiple Currencies' is set in the financial options for AP, multiple currencies can be entered and used in purchasing and catalogs
    Currencies must initially be defined in the General Ledger or through shared application forms in subledger applications
    Suggested foreign currencies can then be recorded on requisition lines
    The default currency on a new requisition is the functional currency specified in financial options for an AP implementation
    If a requisition sources a foreign currency blanket PO or catalog quote, the foreign currency information is defaulted onto the requisition
    Purchasing uses the functional currency to calculate the total on a requistion to validate approved spending limits
    Currency can be entered as a requisition preference in the Req Preferences window to default the currency to each line
    The actual requistion currency is entered in the currency region of the requisition either through Purchasing or through Self Service iProcurement

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Matching:
    Matching can be two way (PO/Invoice), three way (PO/Invoice/Receipt) and four way (PO/Invoice/Receipt/Inspection)
    Four way matching is available for inventory items but not expense items
    Matching is governed by tolerances which can be set by quantity or value: on the Invoice Tolerance form
    Invoices entered in AP are matched to PO's for each invoice line by entering the PO number against the invoice line on the 'Match to Purchase Orders' form

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Receiving:
    Receiving References
        FAQ - Receiving.RECEIPTS [ID 1249431.1]
        Periods - Aid To Resolving Receiving Transaction Date Error APP-PO-14376 PO_CNL_NO_PERIOD, PO_INV_NO_OPEN_PERIOD and PO_PO_ENTER_OPEN_GL_DATE Errors [ID 1317136.1]
    Tip -> use 'Receiving > Receipts' to create a receipt (this is the 'Expected Receipts' form - you cannot find existing receipts here
           use 'Receiving > Receiving Transactions Summary' to find receipts already created
    Tip -> use the menu item 'Receiving -> Receipts' to find expected receipts and create receipts
    Tip -> you must use the 'Receipts' form to create an initial receipt - don't use receipts inquiry because it will only look for receipts already made.
    Tip -> to receive on the core forms, you must click the line to receive, or it won't save and won't give a receipt number
    Tip -> receiving transactions are different to receipts, and move a receipt to it's final destination
    Tip -> direct delivery automatically creates a final delivery transaction to its final destination for a receipt
    Form -> "Receiving Transactions" is for searching for receipts that need final delivery 'transactions' to move items to their final destination.
        Don't search for receipts already delivered here.
        Use this form to enter inspection information and to move the goods to their final destination
    Form -> "Receipts" is for searching for purchase orders open for receiving. If the routing is 'Direct Delivery' it will also create a receiving transaction to it's final destination
    Receiving includes: recording the receipt, inspecting for quality and moving to it's final destination
    The receiving process can ber manual (enter all values), express (receive everything on a single PO) or cascade (spread a receipt across multiple shipments)
    Additional costs can be captured at time of receipt, including freight and taxes not on the original PO, plus miscellaneous charges and exchange rate shifts
    There are three types of receiving: standard, ,direct, and 'inspection required'
    Exchange rate variance accounts can be posted with the difference between rates at the time the PO was issued, and rates at the time of receiving
    Standard receiving involves receiving at a receiving location such as a dock and creating a separate transaction for put away or final delivery
        In Oracle, you can modify the receipt routing at the organization receiving options level, or at the item level, to Standard receipt routing
        After creating the receiving transaction using the 'Receipts' menu choice, you create the second delivery transaction using the 'Receiving Transactions' menu choice
    Direct receiving limits receipt to the final destination or one-step receiving, otherwise referred to as 'dock-to-stock'
    The final receiving destination can be the requestor, inventory or the shop-floor
    An 'inspection required' receipt is a two step receipt, involving an initial receipt and a quality inspection and final delivery
    Inspection receipts are triggered by tagging the item's receiving options. Inspections can also involve returns to supplier
    Receiving defaults are set at multiple levels: purchasing options, receiving options, supplier, supplier site, inventory organization, and purchase order
    Receiving controls can be entered on the PO line to set tolerances for substitutes, quantity variances and early/late deliveries
    Receiving controls can be set at a high level for Receiving Close Tolerance on the Purchasing Options form
    Receiving close tolerance
    Receipt transactions include: receipts, transfers, deliveries (to final destination), returns to vendors and corrections
        Returns are entered on the receiving window
        Corrections to quantities received are done in the Receiving Corrections window
        You cannot undo or delete a receipt once it is made but you can correct the quantities received and enter new receipt transactions
    Receiving starts with the Find Expected Receipts window which provides a number of criteria, including Receiving Location
    Alternate regions on the 'Find Expected Receipts' window allow you to search on item detail and data ranges
    No PO information is available in the 'Order Information' alternate region of the Receiving form for unordered receipts
    Receiving records: receipt date, shipment no, BOL, shipped date, packing slip no, way/airbill no, carrier, number of containers, receiver, source and comments
    Express receiving assumes the PO or ASN quantity is delivered, and accepts corrections to those quantities from the receiver.
    Express receiving is performed by clicking 'Express' in the Receiving Window and specifying a putaway location for all the listed receipts
    Express receiving is enabled in Purchasing Options (Receiving Options Alternate Region) with the 'Allow Express Transactions' flag
    Blind receiving ignores a quantity check against the PO when the receipt is recorded - the receiver must count every item 'blind' or without PO or ASN information.
        This method is the most time consuming
    Tolerance fences can be specified in ASL's: as percentages that capacity can be increased in a specified timeframe by a supplier
    ASN's accelerate the receiving process, by providing specific information about the receipt expected details: packing slip, carrier, barcode, date and waybill number
    Receiving data recorded includes: packing slip, date, waybill and receipt comments
    Purchase order lines are closed when the receipts are processed, and the purchase order is automatically closed when all lines on the PO are closed
    Cascade receipts applies a single 'available to receive' quantity to multiple receipt lines in displayed order from earliest promise date
    The option to cascade is set in the Purchasing Options window
    Closing old PO's with still-open lines require manual procedures or alerts to monitor and notify users to review
    Received items are sent to inventory, users or shop floor depending upon the delivery instructions on the PO lines.
    Receipt Travellers can be printed and attached to received goods to specify internal delivery instructions.
    Receiving substitute items involved choosing the LOV for items on the receiving line and picking the substitute - it must be defined as substitute to appear on the list
    Exercise: Set Purchasing Options -> PURCHASING/Setup/Organizations/Purchasing Options and set the close tolerance to 100% to autoclose all lines for receiving
    Exercise: Set Receiving Options for an Inventory Org -> PURCHASING/Organizations/Receiving Options to set miscellaneous receiving controls
    Exercise: Receive an item -> PURCHASING/Receiving/Receipts, and enter the PO number to receive against, to find the PO details.
        Change the destination type from Receiving, to Inventory, and specify the subinventory
    Exercise: Transact a receipt (route to inspection or inventory) -> PURCHASING/Receiving/Receiving Transactions
    Exercise: View corrections to receiving transactions -> PURCHASING/Receiving/Corrections (enter tran type = "CORRECT' in find dialog)
    Exercise: Return a receipt -> PURCHASING/Receiving/Returns (specify quantity of candidate returns to make)

Purchasing  and Receiving (PO) Notes on Entering a Receipt:
    01. Navigate to the Receipts window and query back a purchase order that is available for receiving.
    02. Check you are in the correct operating unit organization for receiving. The OPU abbreviation will be in the form window header. Change Organization is a navigator menu option
    02. Fill out the receiving header information and save.
    03. Choose the Lines Alternate region on the receipts window and click the checkbox for the line to receive.
    04. Enter the destination type (expense, inventory or shop floor) and fill out the remaining information - actual quantity received, and other line details
    05. Use the Details alternate region to record the packing list, supplier lot, reason code and comments.
    06. Save the work and the system will generate a receipt transaction number.

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Entering an Unordered Receipt:(see Setup > Organizations > Receiving Options)
    Unordered receipts are controlled by the receiving option 'Allow Unordered Receipts'
    Unordered receipts can be entered with no reference to a purchase order, and later tied to a PO after it is entered
    You cannot receive an unordered receipt in the self service procurement functions - the option is not available (as of version 11.5.9)
    Unordered receipts can only be entered as standard 'receiving' destination type transactions and must be subsequently accepted and delivered to their final destination through additional receiving transactions
    Once matched, an unordered receipt needs to be received at its final destination to create the final receiving transaction.
    The supplier on the unordered receipt must match the supplier on the purchase order when it is subsequently matched.
    The item and purchasing category on the receipt must match the item and purchasing category on the purchase order
    The PO must have a receipt routing of Standard Recipt, Inspection Required, or None. Otherwise the profile option RCV: Allow Routing Override must be set
    Exercise: Enter an unordered receipt -> PURCHASING/Receiving/Receipts, and click the unordered button on the receiving header to show the unordered receiving form
        The Unordered button is at the bottom of the Find form if enabled in receiving options for the receiving organization
    Exercise: Match Unordered Receipts to a purchase order
        Purchasing Super User/Match Unordered Receipts ...
            and search for receipt entered previously as unordered,
            then enter the Purchase Order Number
    Profile Option -> RCV: Allow Routing Override allows receiving

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Receiving Transaction Processor
    The Receiving Transaction Processor imports ASN's and Receipts through the Receiving Open Interface Tables
    Pending transactions can be viewed through 'Receiving' > 'Transaction Status Summary'
        If no transactions are found via this form, then no transactions are pending

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Approvals, Approval Groups and Approval Position Hierarchies:
    Approvals can use two different paths: employee/supervisor, or position hierarchies.
    Employee/Supervisor hiearchies look at the supervisor link in a person's assignment record for their supervisor
    Position hierarchies find the position for the person, navigate to the position above and find the encumbent of that position
        Position hierarchies are high maintenance due to HR changes impacting position hierarchy integrity
        Most implementations avoid position hierarchies due to maintenance and the inability to preserve their integrity
    The approval can be sent to the position with sufficient approval directly (direct method) through each position (hierarchy method) even though they lack final approval authority
    Since more than one person can be assigned to a position
        the alphabetical first person is chosen if multiple encumbants are found
    Position Hierarchies are created through the Position Hierarchy form
            The form has peculiar behaviours to query existing hierarchies and create new hierarchies
                To query an existing hierarchy, first query the top region of the form and then separately query the bottom region after clicking 'Exists in Hierarchy'
                If you don't click 'Exists in Hierarchy' before querying the bottom half of the form, it will query back the full list of possible positions.
                To create a new position hierarchy, you need to create a hierarchy name, then save, then query the top position
                    (eg F11 query on 'PRESIDENT%' to bring in the top position)
                After adding each person to the bottom half of the form, save before proceeding.
                Position hierarchies must defined from the top most position down - start at the top of the hierarchy. You cannot add a  top position later
            The position hierarchy is used for two purposes: document approval routing and document security control
                The position hierarchy is assigned as the security hierarchy for document security in the Purchasing Options: Control alternate region
                The position hierarchy is assigned as the approval hierarchy for each document type in the document types window
        Position approval hierarchies are turned on in the financial options (HR tab) - in the checkbox 'Use Approval Hierarchies'
        Position hierarchies can be defined multiple times for multiple purposes and have names associated with each position in the hierarchy.
        The person who is alphabetically first in order in a position hierarchy is routed the approval request first
        Position hierarchies require job and position definitions in HR
            Jobs are sets of responsibilities like Buyer, Receiver, Cost Accountant, VP or Manager.
            Positions are specific slots in an org chart such as Buyer-East Coast
            Positions are related together in a position hierarchy.
    Approval groups include rules defined to set limits on approval authorities
        Approval rules are defined for each approval group
        Approval groups require (at a minimum) a document total line and an account range line
            All other line types are optional: Item Category Range, item range, location.
            Rules can cover: specific document types (eg PO), account ranges, item ranges, category ranges, and locations
            If two or more approval lines are created in an approval group, the most restrictive line is used to determine approval authority
            Approval Groups limit approvals by account range, location, item category range and item range for document total values
    Assignment of Approval Groups assigns approval groups to document types and to positions (or jobs) in the approval hierarchy
    Fill Employee Hierarchy - to assign employees to the position approval hierarchy based on their current primary position assignments
    Approval Groups -> click on low value to display account ranges for included accounts
    Approval Groups -> if position approval hierarchies are turned on in Financial Options, the Approval Groups form only allows searching on positions and not jobs
    Approval Groups -> if position approval hierarchies are turned off in Financial Options, the Approval Groups form only allows searching on jobs and not positions
    Navigations are:
        Create positions ->  ..../Positions
        Create a position hierarchy (if HR is not installed) s-> PSU/Setup/Personnel/Position Hierarchy
        Create a position hierarchy (if HR is installed) -> HRSU/Work Structures/Position/Hierarchy,
            and query both regions of the form (click 'Exists in Hierarchy' on in lower region query)
        Create approval groups -> Purchasing/Setup/Approvals/Approval Groups to create approval groups for doc totals,
        Assign approval groups -> PSU/Setup/Approvals/Approval Assignments, to assign an approval group to a position or job
        Assign position hierarchy as security hierarchy -> ..../Purchasing Options/
        Assign position hierarchy as the approval hierarchy (for each doctype) -> PSU/Setup/Purchasing/Document Types
    Exercise: Turn on approval hierarchies in financial options -> PSU/Setup/Organizations/Financial Options/Human Resources, and click 'Use Approval Hierarchies' on
    Exercise: Fill the position hierarchy -> Concurrent manager/Fill Employee Hierarchy
    Exercise: Approve PO's and Requ's -> PSU/Notifications and click on each approval notification to review and approve.

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Notification and Delegation Rules and Vacation Rule and Worklist Access
    Notifications for PO approvals can be redirected or delegated
    See Metalink Note: Note:221915.1 "How to Reassign Purchase Order Approval Notifications"
        This uses the navigation: "Workflow User Web Applications"
    See Metalink Note: 248076.1 "How to Setup Default Notification Rules in Workflow"
    In 11.5.10 and 12.0.0 Vacation Rules and Worklist Access options allow others to act on your notifications
        Navigation -> Workflow User Web Applications/Advanced Worklist/Tip - Worklist Access (and define rules)
        Worklist Access grants notification access to another user - in effect providing a delegation of authority
        The granted user can act as a proxy or delegate and act on the notifications
        The granted user can do most things that the original user can do to the notifications
           The granted user will get a 'Switch User' option on their notifications list to see other users' notifications
        Worklist Access is stored in the FND_GRANTS table in the APPLSYS schema

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Security:
    Security levels (visibility) and access levels (privileges) work together to restrict who can access a document and what they can do with that document
    A security level of public gives everyone visibility to the document ie the ability to open the document
    Security (visibility) levels are: public (open), private (owner and approvers), purchasing (owner, approvers and buyers) and hierarchy (owners, approvers and people above as defined by the approval hierarchy)
    An access level of Full means anyone with the ability to open the document has the privileges to make any changes to the document
    The person who creates a purchasing document is the owner. The owner can always change the document and has full access.
    Access levels are:
        view only (people with visibility can view only),
        modify (view, modify, freeze, close) and
        full (view, modify, freeze, close, final close, delete)

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on ERS and Payment on Receipt (aka Self-Billing)
    ERS or Payment on Receipt creates an invoice when goods are received, rather than waiting on an invoice from the supplier
    ERS is enabled on a standard purchase order by clicking the 'Terms' button and entering 'Receipt' in the 'Pay On' field
    ERS creates an unapproved invoice based on receipt of goods and purchase order information, triggered by an ASN or physical receipt.
    ASN's and ASBN's can also trigger payment on receipt because they are processed as receiving records
    ERS is also known as payment on receipt and self-billing
    ERS options allow different levels of invoice creation and grouping: packing slip, receipt, or supplier site
    To generate ERS draft invoices, the concurrent process 'Payment on Receipt' autoinvoice program must be run after receipts are posted in Purchasing and Receiving
    Profile Option -> PO: ERS Aging Period, defines the delay in days before an ERS invoice is created after the goods are received
    Profile Option -> PO: ERS Invoice Number Prefix, assigns a character prefix to all ERS invoice numbers

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on ERS and Payment on Receipt (aka Self Billing) Concurrent Processes:
    Pay on Receipt Autoinvoice concurrent process is scheduled to run constantly - automatically creates invoices based on received amounts
    Pay on receipt is setup as an option for a supplier, to be paid on shipment receipt or on final delivery
    Pay on Receipt grouping of invoices can be at the packing slip, receipt or supplier site level
    The Pay on Receipt Autoinvoice program generates invoices for receipts and matches the invoice to the corresponding purchase orders

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Procurement Cards or pCards - Overview:
    pCards can only be added to requisitions in iProcurement and not requisitions in core purchasing. Core purchasing pcard requs are not supported.
    pCards are credit cards that enable the purchaser to buy directly from the supplier and eliminate a large number of small value invoice transactions
    pCards can be assigned to requisitions in iProcurement directly, but not in Purchasing.
        This allows automatic creation and approval of purchase orders
    pCards bypass the need for requisitioning all together or can be used on requisitions to automate the payment process.
    pCard processing imports charge details from a pCard processor (corporte card) and
        verified directly through web-expenses by each employee (and charged to a project).
    Employees can override the default accounting treatment on web expenses and add project numbers and change cost centers
    pCards are useful for buying expensed items but not capital or inventory items, since there is no way of adding the inventory or asset information in iExpenses
    pCards can't buy asset items since AP processes pCards without matching to PO's. Normally AP sends Mass Addition assets to FA based on PO flags indicating an asset purchase
    pCards can't buy project capital items through self service because the project id can't be added in SSP at the time of purchase
    pCards can only be used with expense item purchases,
        cannot be used with encumbrance accounting,
        cannot be used for project purchases and
        do not accrue payables on receipt

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Procurement Cards (pCards) Business Process:
    Employees purchase items from suppliers using pCards
    The card issuer such as American Express sends the pCard transactions to the employer for payment
    The pCard transactions are imported directly into AP or through mapping software (such as Accounting Link - for Amex)
    The import process automatically generates accounting distributions for expenses
    The invoice to pay the card issuer is automatically built from the imported pCard transactions
    Self service applications can be setup to verify transactions and override accounting distributions by sending the purchases to the employee for review
    Transactions from the pCard company are loaded into AP_EXPENSE_FEED_LINES
    A process 'pCard Transactions Validation Report' is run after loading to identify invalid transactions and build default GL account distributions
    Next, the 'Distribute Employee Credit Transactions' process is started, which kicks off a workflow 'AP pCard Employee Verification'to send to employees via notifications
    The employee verifies and approves the notification details in self service
    The manager approval workflow 'Manager Approval for pCard' is started by another concurrent process for manager approvals of these expenses
    Adjustments including splits of accounting distributions can be made in the form 'Credit Card Transactions' in AP
    Invoices are created  by transfering lines after approval from AP_EXP_FEED_DISTRIBUTIONS to AP_HEADER and AP_LINES,  by running the Payables Open Interface
    Finally, Invoices are processed within AP normally for approval and payment

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Procurement Cards (pCards) Setups:
    Overall Setup involves establishing a pCard program, pCard profile, and actual pcards.  Each supplier site that can accept pCards must have it's 'pCard Allowed' flag set at the site level.
    Additional setups include creating Credit Card Code Sets, and Credit Card GL Sets to allow users to change accounts during credit card transaction approval.
    Setup credit card issuer as a supplier (and setup their bank info if payment is via EFT)
    Setup the pCard Program to establish a pCard and pCard issuer (supplier) and supplier site to pay the pcards. Also use to establish the default clearing account and excluded transactions
    Setup the pCard Account Set and Account Set members to establish accounts that will override the employee default expense account on import of credit card txns, based on the incoming 'card code'
    Setup a pCard GL Account Set to establish a list of accounts a user can change during workflow approval of transactions. This is associated to a pCard Profile
    Setup a pCard Profiles to apply to a single program. Each profile is a set of characteristics that default to cards in the program: over-ride clearing account, employee and manager approval notice levels, spending limits on ranges of card numbers
    Setup employees who are pCard holders, if required
    Setup each pCard and assign it to a pCard profile. Assign the card to an employee (optional) or supplier and the supplier's eligible sites
    Modify the supplier site general attributes to allow pCards for each supplier site where pCard is allowed. Set pCard Allowed = Yes in the General region of the supplier site

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Note on Procurement Cards (pCards) Accounting:
    pCards account distributions are defaulted to the employee's default expenses account on the employee profile
    Default account distributions are over-ridden by the GL default account distribution on the pCard profile
    pCard profile account distributions are over-ridden by credit card code sets that look up account values based on codes attached to the card transaction

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Procurement Cards (pCards) Profile Options:
    PO: Use P-Cards in Purchasing
    POR: Override Supplier p-Card (yes/no)

Purchasing and Receiving (PO Schema) Notes on Notifications

Sales Compensation (???) Notes:
    Sales Compensation is a CRM product that calculates commissions payable to the sales force.
    Sales events are defined as commission events to trigger the accrual of sales commissions
    Sales compensation tags each order line with a revenue class category.
        Categories can be defined along lines of industry, market, service, product etc
    The commission is calculated from
        the value of the sale times the compensation factor of the revenue class within the assigned category
    Direct sales, agents and distributors can be paid commissions through Sales Compensation
    Credit for a sale can be shared among a salesforce, either by
        splitting the commissions or
        giving all the full commission
    Quota credits are calculated with different commission rates to achieve quota, and commission accelerators for quota bands over 100%
    Plans can clawback commissions for cancelled sales or uncollectable invoices from customers
    Sales are fed from Receivables rather than Order Management, for calculating commissions
        This ensures commissions are paid on final billed values.
        This ensures sales compensation ties out with revenue flows
    Commission data is originally captured by Order Management:
        sales person, commission class, price list, etc.

Sales Online (???) Notes:
    Sales online tracks:
        the pipeline of sales leads,
        assigned sales reps and
        the actual products and expected sales value of the lead or opportunity
    Sales Online is a Java/Web Based interface like iProcurement

Service (???) Notes:
    Service tracks:
        the installed base of products installed with customers,
        the support of those products delivered by phone,
        onsite calls or returns for factory repair
    Service contracts and warranties, and implied warranties on the sale are recorded as part of the service commitment
    Service attributes are carried on the inventory master items and on items at the Organization levels
        including flags to indicate if service is billable
    Order Management populates the installed base records in the shipping confirm process
    BOM can create an 'as-built' configuration to track changes to the product as it is upgraded and repaired
        (at the customer site or at the factory)
    For warranty replacement of parts,
        Service will track the serial number of the replacement parts for continued warranty support
    Terms and conditions in warranties and service agreements codify
        the length of service,
        days of week, hours of the day of service,
        whether repair parts are covered, and
        billable shipping costs
    Workflow is used in Service to escalate service requests from telephone to onsite to depot return or replacement,
        including warnings for overdue service issues
    Depot repair process includes:

SQL*Loader (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on General Functionality:
    Oracle Loader (or SQL*Loader) loads data from a text file into one or more Oracle tables, with indexes, based on a set of control file parameters
    The control file has a .ctl extension (if there is no extension specified, Loader assumes it is .ctl) and contains parameters and data mappings between the input text file and the Oracle tables being loaded.
    Invalid records that are not loaded are logged into an error file in a location determined by the 'error=' parameter.
    Loader is run from the command line as 'sqlldr.exe' located in the \bin subdirectory of the Oracle home directory.
    Loader takes command line parameters either positionally (in the correct order) or as parameters (parm1=, parm2= etc) and most parameters are optional. A typical min set of parameters is -> sqlldr userid=username/pwd control=cfile.ctl
    A session log is written to control.log and bad records are written to control.bad (where control is the name of the control file)

SQL*Loader (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Control File Parameters
    parallel=true runs the loader in parallel mode by dividing the loader process into parallel segments. Indexes cannot be loaded in this mode. In this mode, several temporary tables are used, and merged as a final step.
    direct=true runs the loader in direct mode, where date is formatted in memory to match the database blocks on disk, and subsequently copied. This mode runs faster than conventional mode. It is compatible with parallel mode.
    skip=n a number that defaults to 0, and Loader will skip the first n lines and start loading at n+1. This is good for multi-step loads
    load=n will load n records and then stop.
    discard=filename sends all discarded records to filename, where discarding is determined by conditions set for loading each row. If not specified, no discard file is created

SQL*Loader (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on the Control File
    Use '--' for comments in the control file
    start the file (other than comments) with 'load data' (omit the quotes)
    'infile' identifies the data file to be loaded, eg 'infile.dat' with the single quotes
    into table tablename - identifies the table to be loaded (eg into table purchase_orders)
    field mapping specifications include the column name, position start and finish, format and format mapping (eg (first_name position(01:14) char...)
    The default mode is insert (into an empty table) and options on the 'into table' line are append, replace, and truncate. Replace and truncate do the same thing. If the target table is not empty, append must be used instead of insert
    Filters can be put on the load process in the control file, on a separate line eg (when first_name <> 'John' will discard all 'John' records)

Subledger Accounting (XLA Schema) Notes on General Functionality
    Seeded setups in Subledger Accounting are owned by Oracle
        They must be copied and renamed to be modified and ownership automatically changes from 'Oracle' to 'User'
    SLA is event based - it turns transactions into events
        and applies accounting rules to the events to derive/override accounting
    Subledger Accounting is introduced in R12 along with Ledgers (rather than Sets of Books)
    This is done along with the change from SET_OF_BOOKS_ID to LEDGER_ID in the GL tables
    It was introduced to allow multiple accounting representations (timing and definition of accounting events) to be created to meet different reporting requirements
        Different accounting representations include: GAAP, IFRS, Cash etc
    Subledger Accounting is a service and not an application
        SLA forms and concurrent programs are accessible from within other applications (sub-ledgers) and not directly accessible
        SLA stores cross references between distributions in the subledgers and additional data but does not store source subledger distributions directly
        Accounting Methods Builder is an SLA service to create distributions in the subledger and replace the workflows for Account Generator
    Subledger Accounting implements the accounting concept of 'Day Books'
        In 'Day Books' details of the transaction are records for future accounting including key business attributes
    Subledger Accounting derives appropriate accounts based on business events for all subledgers
        The distributions are still derived in each subledger's and stored in their account distributions tables
        However, preliminary accounting distributions derived in each subledger act as default distributions in Subledger Accounting
            They can be modified by rules in Subledger Accounting or passed through to the General Ledger unmodified
            The seeded rules in SLA simply derive the accounting as 'take from subledger distribution' unless the rules are modified
            Subledger Accounting Rules triggered by Accounting Events modify these default distributions
            Any changes to accounting distributions made in SLA are not pushed back to the sub-ledger
                This is because (for example) the subledger can't store multiple representations of the same accounting even
        Any attribute captured with the accounting event can be used in the rule to derive the accounting distribution
    Subledger Accounting stores a complete and balanced journal entry for each financial transaction in the subledgers
    Subledger Accounting can be called by external systems via the Oracle Financial Services Accounting Hub
    Subledger Accounting includes a posting engine to summarize and post transactions to the GL
        The posting engine is a single process for posting all subledger entries to the GL
    In R12, Subledger Accounting succeeds and supercedes the Global Accounting Engine
        It also supplements AutoAccounting in Accounts Receivable by adding a back-end to override the AutoAccounting results or simply act as a pass-through
    Multiple accounting representations can be created from a single accounting event
        Multiple accounting representations allows the same transaction to be posted to different books (or ledgers within a ledger set)
        Each accounting representation can use different charts of accounts, calendars, currencies, and subledger accounting methods.
   Subledger Accounting is a single set of tables for reporting detail accounting distribution activity across all subledgers from a single point
        Reporting off the subledger is supported by XML Publisher

Subledger Accounting (XLA Schema) Notes on Key Entities
    Subledger Accounting Methods (SLAM)
        These are the different Valuation or Accounting Methods that can be used for financial reporting
            One SLAM includes Application Accounting Definitions for all Subledgers (Accounting Applications)
        There are very few valuation (accounting) methods and they are pre-defined:
        e.g. STANDARD_ACCRUAL, STANDARD_CASH, UNITED_STATES_FEDERAL, JA_CN_STANDARD_ACCRUAL, ENCUBRANCE_ACCRUAL, ENCUMBRANCE_CASH
        Everything defined under one of these methods are considered Accounting Methods definitions
            Navigation: AP Superuser > Setup > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setups > Accounting Methods Builder > Methods and Definitions > Subledger Accounting Definitions > Find
        All the tools and forms used to create these methods are collectively the Accounting Methods Builder
        Accounting Event Classes and events are different and have different timing in different accounting methods
            e.g. cash accounting generates on AP Invoice Event (entry/payment)
            e.g. accrual accounting generates two events (entry, then payment)
    Application Accounting Definition (AAD) Assignments to SLAMs
        Navigation: AP Superuser > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setup > Accounting Methods Builder > Methods and Definitions > Application Accounting Definitions
        AAD Assignments link SLAM's and Application Accounting Definitions (Event Class Collections)
        The Event Class and Event Type Assignments in an AAD represent Journal Headers
            Journal Entry Descriptions can be attached via the 'Header Assignments' button on the AAD Maintenance page
    Application Accounting Definition (AAD)
        A named 'Collection' of Event Classes and Event Types for a single Application that can be assigned to a SLAM
            e.g. Invoices (ALL Events) and Expense Reports (ALL Events) for the Accounts Payable Application
            All the Event Classes for an Applicatoin are included in the Application Accounting Definition
        Application Accounting Definitions can be limited to a Chart of Accounts (Transaction or Accounting)
        Validation is required before an Application Accounting Definition can be used (via the 'Validate' button on the Definition form)
            The Validation Status is shown against each Event Class and Event Type in the Application Accounting Definition
        Journal Line Definitions are assigned to the Application Accounting Definition if they share the same Event Class and Event Type
            If the Event Type is set to ALL on the Class/Event Assignment Line, then all Journal Line Definitions with the same Event Class are available for assignment
        Application Accounting Definitions can be exported and imported to support testing across environments using concurrent programs
            Import Application Accounting Definitions and Export Application Accounting Definitions are concurrent programs
    Entities and Event Classes and Event Class Options
        Entities are the transaction supertypes and classes are the types within the subledger application
        For Receivables, the primary entities are: Transactions, Receipts, Adjustments and Bills Receivable
        For Assets, the primary entities are: Transactions, Depreciation, Inter-Asset Transactions, Deferred Depreciation
        For Payables, the primary entities are: Invoices and Payments
            For Invoices, the primary event classes include: Standard Invoices, Credit Memos, Debit Memos, Expense Reports (the Invoice Entity supertype)
            For the Payment Entity, the primary event classes are: Prepayments, Payments, Refunds (the Payment Entity supertype)
        Entities are defined in the Event Modeller 'Entities' form
            Navigation: Payables Manager > Setup > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setups > Accounting Methods Builder > Events > Event Model
            The Gapless Event Processing option control accounting on a sequence of event numbers
                Accounting cannot occur on an event if the prior event is not accounted for an instance of an entity (e.g an invoice_id)
                The Identifers page shows the source table identifer from the subledger and the column where it is referenced in XLA_TRANSACTION_ENTITIES
        Entities correspond with object super-classes in programming
        Event Classes correspond with inherited object classes (subclasses) in object-oriented programming
        Event Classes are defined in the Event Modeller 'Event Classes and Types' form
            This is reached from  the 'Event Classes' button on the 'Entities' form
            Navigation: Payables Manager > Setup > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setup > Accounting Methods Builder > Events > Event Model > Event Classes (button)
            Each Event Class is assigned a code, name and description and can be enabled or disabled
            Each Event Class is also assigned multiple Event Types (methods)
                e.g. Types (or methods) for AP Event Class 'Invoices' include: Invoice Validated, Invoice Adjusted, and Invoice Cancelled
            Each Event Class can have predecessors defined
                Predecessors are event classes that must be accounted beforehand
                e.g An invoice must be accounted prior to a payment on the same invoice
                Navigation: AP Superuser > Setup > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setups > Accounting Methods Builder > Events > Event Model (Entities) > Event Classes > Predecessors
        Not all event classes are capable of generating accounting events - e.g. Supplier Setup
        Accounting Events within an Event Class are the actual transactions or event object instances
        Transactions correspond with instances of a class in object-oriented programming
        Process Categories are groupings of Event Classes used by the 'Create Accounting' process (as an optional run parameter)
            Navigation: Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setups > Accounting Methods Builder > Events > Process Categories
            Process Categories are seeded in Oracle and cannot be modified
            Process Categories allow the 'Create Accounting' process to be run for a subset of Event Classes within an application
                It also allows forcing the correct order for 'Create Accounting' where Event Classes have predecessors
            A Process Category is assigned to an Event Class in Accounting Event Class Options
                Navigation: Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setups > Accounting Methods Builder > Events > Accounting Event Class Options
                e.g. Invoices, Payments, Third Party Merge
        Accounting Event Class Options are defined for each Accounting Event Class
            Navigation: Payables Manager > Setup > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setup > Accounting Methods Builder > Events > Accounting Event Class Options
            These setups are overridden by settings in Subledger Accounting Options
            The Journal Category is assigned to the Event Class in Event Class Options
            A Process Category is assigned to the Event Class also (see 'Process Categories' above)
            Informational Fields (Transaction Identifiers) are assigned to an Event Class in Event Class Options
                These are based on the Transaction View also defined on Accounting Event Class Options
                Each field in the view is mapped to a User Identifier Name which is exposed to the user in place of the column name
                These information fields are displayed in Tools > View Accounting Events > View Journal Entries from the subledger forms
        Sources
            Sources are generated after Accounting Event Classes are fully defined by running Create and Assign Sources 'Create and Assign Sources'
                This program validates all Accounting Event definitions and creates sources for all reference objects
                    It also assigns the generated sources to Event Classes within each application
                The results are viewed on the Sources page and Source Assignments page
                    Navigation: AP Superuser > Setups > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setups > Accounting Methods Builder > Sources > Sources
                    Navigation: AP Superuser > Setups > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setups > Accounting Methods Builder > Sources > Source Assignments
                Source Assignments are assigned to Accounting Attributes via Accounting Attribute Assignments
                    Navigation: AP Superuser > Setups > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setups > Accounting Methods Builder > Sources > Accounting Attribute Assignments
                    Accounting Attributes are used to create subledger journal entries
                    One Accounting Attribute (e.g. Accounted Amount on Paybles Invoices) can have multiple sources assigned
                    These Accounting Attribute Assignments are defaults and can be overridden at the Joural Line Type level
    Event Types and Events
        Each class can have multiple event types (methods)
        e.g. for class STANDARD_INVOICES, there are types: STANDARD_CREATED, STANDARD_FULLY_REVERSED, STANDARD_DISTRIBUTE, STANDARD_OVERRIDE_TAX, etc
        Event Types correspond to class methods
        Each event class is subtyped from an event entity and has distinct Event Types (or methods)
        Each time an Event Type occurs on an Event Class Object, an Event Number is generated
        e.g. Invoice Created ('Invoice' event class object instance, with a Creation Event Type)
        Journals headers are defined at the level of Event Class and Event Type combination (in Application Accounting Definition)
            For each combination of Event Class and Event Type (i.e. Journal Header) a collection of Jouranl Lines are assigned (a Journal Line Definition)
        Events are stored in XLA_EVENTS with EVENT_TYPE_CODE and ENTITY_ID as foreign keys
     Journal Line Types
        Navigation: Payables Manager > Setup > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setup > Accounting Methods Builder > Journal Entry Setups > Journal Line Types
        Journal Line types are different structures of different journal lines (e.g. Freight Expense)
            They cannot be modified directly but they can be copied from Oracle owned to User owned and then renamed, changed and used to replace the original Line Types
        Journal Line Types are assembled into Journal Line Definitions which comprise all the journal lines an Event Class can create
        A Journal Line Type is a unique combination of Application, Event Class and Accounting Class
            Accounting Class is used by the Journal Posting program to group postings to the Ledger
            Accounting Classes are grouped into Post-Accounting Programs which are used to identify journal entries that must be created by specific processes
            Accounting Class is defined as subledger accounting lookups and can be added as needed
                e.g. Application: Payables, Event Class: Invoices, Accounting Class: Item Expense - conditions include Invoice Distribution Type 'Item' or 'Invoice Price Variance' or 'Exchange Rate Variance'
                Navigation: Payables Superuser > Setup > Lookups > Subledger Accounting Lookups (Type XLA_ACCOUNTING_CLASS)
        Conditions are defined for each Journal Line Type to decide when the Line Type is created and used
            Conditions can include references to Invoice Distribution Types and accounting options
    Journal Line Definition Assignments (JLD) to Event Classes
        Links event classes to a collection of Journal Line Definitions
        They determine the types of journal lines that can be generated by an event class
        e.g. For AP Invoices in Payables can generate: An Accrual Charge, Gain/Loss, Withholding Tax
    Journal Line Definition (JLD)
        Navigation: AP Superuser > Setup > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setup > Accounts Method Builder > Methods And Definitions > Journal Line Definitions
        Journal Line Definitions tie Event Class and Event Type combinations (journal headers) to Journal Line Types and their Account Derivation Rules
        They comprise a named 'Collection' of Journal Line Types that are assigned as a group to a single event class and event type
            e.g. Event Class ACCRUAL_INVICES_ALL, and Event Type ALL
        A Journal Line Definition is specific to an application event class and event type
        There is a separate Journal Line Definition for each Subledger Accounting Method (SLAM) which applies to an event class
            i.e. a different definition for the journal line for each different accounting convention or SLAM
        A Journal Line Definition can include multiple Journal Line Type records (e.g Withholding Tax, Gain/Loss, Accrual Charge)
            Each Journal Line Type can include one or more Account Derivation Rules (multiple if each segment has a separate rule)
            The Description for the Journal Line Type can be specified, or flagged as 'Inherit' to derive automatically from Journal Line Type Flow rules
                One Account Derivation Rule can be specified for all segments, and additional Account Derivation Rules assigned to override individual segments
            Each Journal Line Type is assigned Account Derivation Rules which can be one for all segments or separate rules for each segment
            Supporting references are added to the Journal Line Type also, if needed
        A Journal Line Definition can optionally have a Chart of Account specified (either 'Transaction' or 'Accounting')
            This will limit when the definition is used, as well as limit the Account Derivation Rules available
    Mapping Sets
        Mapping Sets are translation tables that map entity attributes onto account values to modify account segments
            Navigation: AP Superuser > Setup > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setups > Journal Entry Setups > Mapping Sets
        Mapping Sets are used in Account Derivation Rules to derive account strings or segment values
            The choice of Mapping Sets is only available in Account Derivation Rules if a Chart of Accounts is specified in the Account Derivation Rule (either Transaction or Accounting)
        A Value Setup must be created first (or found) to establish the 'Input' Values in the Mapping Set
            Navigation: AP Superuser > Setup > Flexfields > Validation > Sets
        The 'Output' values are defined by segment values in the Chart of Accounts (or a combination of Segment Values)
            The Chart of Accounts field can be left blank if the same Output value set applies across multiple chart of accounts
            Specifying a Chart of Accounts limits the Mapping Set Usage to a single chart
    Account Derivation Rule (ADR)
        Navigation: Payables Manager > Setup > Accounting Setups > Subledger Accounting Setup > Accounts Method Builder > Journal Entry Setups > Account Derivation Rules
        Seeded and saved rules must be copied and renamed - they cannot be modfied once saved
            When copied the owner automatically changes from 'Oracle' to 'User'
        Account Derivation Rules can be used in any application with a common Reference Object defined in Accounting Event Class Options
        Account Derivation Rules are used to build account strings based on rules (which derive account values) and conditions (which determine when the rules is applied)
        They can comprise a set of rules for each segment or for all segments as a single combined rule
            They are assigned to Journal Line Types in Journal Line Definitions
            Each rule comprising one or more prioritized 'sub' rules
        Chart of Accounts values in ADR definition are 'Transaction' or 'Accounting' (or neither or both)
            The choice defines the type of rule and the choices of output type
            Choosing either a Transaction or Accounting Chart limits the Output Types of Flexfield and Segment
            Transaction means the chart of accounts used on the originating transaction - the primary books chart
            Accounting means the chart of accounts used in the Accounting Subledger (which can be the primary book or a secondary book)
                The balancing segment entity is only available as an Output Type if the Accounting Chart of Accounts is specified on its own
            Choosing a Chart of Accounts puts a restriction on where the Account Derivation Rule can be used (i.e. transactions using this chart)
                Choosing an Output Type without a Chart of Accounts is the least restrictive and the rule can be used anywhere
        Output Type in ADR definition determines the type of output for the rule (Flexfield combination, Segment or Value Set)
            'Flexfield' can only be specified if a Chart of Accounts is specified (either Transaction or Accounting)
            'Segment' refers to an individual account segment
        Using an output type of Segment without a Chart of Accounts will limit the Value Types available on rule lines to Account Derivation Rule and Source
            Specifying a Chart of Accounts (Transaction or Accounting or both) makes the Value Types 'Constant' and 'Mapping Set' available also
        Conditions
            The conditions for an Account Derivation Rule determine when the rule will apply
            All the conditions assigned to a specific Account Derivation Rule must be met for the rule to apply (if they are 'AND'ed together)
            If the condition source is a key flexfield, then a segment qualifier can be chosen.

    Tax recovery rates on recoverable tax cannot be overridden on payables invoices until they are generated and saved by viewing All Distributions. 
        Generating and saving via All Distributions makes them accessible for override via drill-down from line distributions. 
    Tax distributions are created when you click on All Distributions or upon invoice validation
    The Bill-to address for AP invoices used by eBTax comes from the Operating Unit (not the legal entity or establishment address)

    For employee expenses, the ship from and bill from are null on tax determining attributes
        So the registration rule can point to bill from to avoid self-assessment (since there is no 'enable self assessment flag there)
    There is a concurrent program 'Run Diagnostics Tests' under the System Administrator responsibility
        It can be run with the application name parameter: 'E-Business Tax'
        An alternative is to run the tax diagnostics under the 'Oracle Diagnostics Tool' responsibility
    If you change a tax to self-assess on the tax lines, you must requery the invoice to see the correct tax on the invoice lines summary tab
    The tab sequence is broken on several setup forms
        Tabbing out of Configuration Owner on the Tax setup form
        Tabbing out of Tax on the Tax Status form
        Tabbing out of Tax Status on the Tax Rates form
        Tabbing out of Configuration Owner on the Tax Rules form
    If Tax Groups are not defined in 11i no tax rules will be generated in R12
        This is because the conversion process uses the Tax Group Name as the Rule Name in R12
        It ties the STCC into this rule as the Determining Factor Set and creates a Direct Tax Determination Type Rule
    You must run Geography Name Referencing in TCA to get taxes to calculate automatically - even for direct determination
    You cannot disable a Configuration Tax Owner's subscription to an application and event class
        Taxes will continue to calculate after the effective end-date or if disabled or both
        You have to end-date and then create a new subscription for the same event with the Tax Applicability Checkbox disabled
        You cannot disable the Tax Applicability box on an existing subscription - it is frozen so a new subscription is required
    Set the Profile Option = Tax: Debug Flag at the user level to 'Yes' to get additional detail in the concurrent log
        Search for string in the output matching:
            Return_Status = E
            Return_Status = U
            ORA-
    If Direct Tax Determination is used, tax rules must be defined to avoid the default tax rate being invoked
        Condition sets and determining factor sets must be defined for the rules first
    The Bill-to for Payables Invoices is the default address of the legal establishment attached to the buying operating unit
        Any tax rules based on bill-to for payables will always evaluate to this one address.

        The following must occur for a Direct Tax Rate Determination rule to be applicable:
            The Direct Tax Rate Determination rule must evaluate to true
            The tax rate code must be defined for the product family
            The place of supply must evaluate successfully except in the case of migrated taxes when Allow multiple jurisdictions is selected

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes on Procedures
    Changing Existing Tax Lines
        You can't cancel a tax line and add a second line with the same Regime and Tax - it is considered a duplicate
            Canceling a tax line is final - you cannot recreate it for the same items
            The workaround is to discard the associated invoice lines and re-enter the line
        You can modify a tax line any number of times until it is validated, but after validation, the adjustment creates a new line upon saving
    Entering a Tax Control Amount on an AP Invoice
        You cannot 'undo' a tax control amount on an AP invoice - once entered the line is tagged as manual and treated as manual
        See: Changing Tax Control Amount to Null Does Not Modify the Existent Calculated Tax Amount [ID 780887.1]

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes on Steps to Analyze if Taxes Don't Calculate
    For AR transactions with no backing sales orders, there must be a warehouse specified if the situs rule is 'ship-from'
        See MOS Note 1082
    Make sure the supplier is enabled for tax ('Allow Tax Applicability' flag') at the 3rd Party and 3rd Party Site levels
        Reference: R12 Supplier Site Transaction Tax Not Set To Yes After Upgrade [ID 1139023.1]
        R12: What Is The Purpose Of The Allow Tax Applicability Checkbox In Customer Site? (Doc ID 1462080.1)
        "Allow tax Applicability" flag not working correctly (Doc ID 1362750.1)
            States this flag is only implemented for suppliers and supplier sites
        Check this on the tax party/site profile and the supplier/site setup
        Note: this flag applies only to suppliers - it is not evaluated for customers
        Search on 'Allow Tax Applicability' in MOS for specific rules
        It may be necessary to use a specific customer or supplier who is enabled for tax
    Make sure the Content Owner is subscribed to the transaction type
    Check the Legal Entity on the Transaction is subscribed to the Tax Regime

Tax Engine (ZX Schema) Notes on Terminology
    Nexus - connection
        References
            http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/glossaryn/g/nexusdef.htm
        A nexus in general means a connection. 
        The term nexus is used in tax law to describe a situation in which a business has a "nexus" or presence in a state
        If an entity has Nexus it is subject to state income taxes and to sales taxes for sales within that state. 
        Nexus describes the amount and degree of business activity that must be present before a state can tax an entity's income. 
        If a taxpayer has nexus in a particular state, the taxpayer must ay and collect/remit taxes in that state.
        Nexus Tests include:
            If the business has a physical location in the state
            If there are resident employees working in the state
            If the business has property (including intangible property) in the state
            if there are employees who regularly solicit business in the state.
    Situs - location (the Place of Supply)
    Zero-Rated - tax is charged at zero % but input taxes to the sales of zero-rated items can be claimed for input tax credit
        Input tax credit cannot be claimed on exempt sales

Tax Engine (ZX Schema) Notes on General Functionality
    The Tax Engine is refered to as e-Business Tax or EBT
    Tax related holds are applied on an invoice when it is validated
    Tax lines can be entered manually on an invoice if the setups allow it
        This includes setting the flags to allow taxes at Regime, Tax, Status and Rate levels

Tax Engine (ZX Schema) Notes on Seeded Responsibilities
    There are three seeded responsibilities in the Oracle Tax Engine
        Tax Manager - setup and maintain tax configuration data
        Tax Administrator - tax technical setup and support responsibilities
        Oracle Tax Simulator - to use the tax simulation feature

Tax Engine (ZX Schema) Notes on Tax Model Setup and Configuration
    Tax Engine entities must be setup for:
        Tax Regimes - is a country or group of countries with common registration settings
            A country defined in the TCA Geography Hieararchy is attached to a Regime when the regime is defined
            Defined as a set of taxes and regulations that establish tax requirements
            A regime is a common set of default information that applies to one or more taxes
                It designates the geography in which the taxes apply
                It defines the use of fiscal classifications
            Tax registrations are done once for each regime
            A Tax Regime must be associated with all First Parties (LE's or OPU's) using configuration options
        Configuration Options - define the relationship between a tax regime and a first party legal entity or operating unit
            They allow flexibility on how regime rules apply to different legal entities in the same regime
        Configuration Owners - parties (legal entities or operating units) which have specific configuration options
            Global Configuration Owner - the owner of all tax setups for a regime
            Specific Legal Entities or Operating Units - can have overriding content ownership to pre-empt the Global Configuration Owner setting
            Stored on the database tables as CONTENT_OWNER_ID
        Taxes - a tax classification such as Sales, Use, VAT, Excise
        Tax Status - are different rate classes for the same tax
            e.g. standard rate, zero rate, partially exempt rate
        Tax Rate - a rate specified for a tax status for an effective date
            Expressed as a percent, rate per unit, or fixed amount
        Tax Recovery Rate (optional) - a full or partial recovery rate
        First Party Legal Entity - an internal legal entity or operating unit
        Country Defaults - for a country
        Configuration Owner Defaults - for the First Party who is the configuration owner
        Application Tax Option Defaults - for installation level default values
    Manual entry of tax can be activated or deactivated at several levels
        Event Class Level (topmost level)
        Configuration Owner (more specific)
        Tax Level (most specific - applies to only one tax for the event class)
        The most specific levels override the higher levels
        Options made possible at these levels include:
            Manual entry of tax lines
            Over-ride of calculated lines
            Recalculate manual tax lines
        Manual tax lines can only be entered if they apply proportionally to all invoice lines

Tax Engine (ZX Schema) Notes on Address Validation
    References
        https://smartystreets.com/
    Address Styles
        Important Note
            The address style validations defined for address entry do not use the same tables and the geography validation process in several instances
                This can be changed so that the validation sets reference the HZ_GEOGRAPHY tables if needed.
            The reason is that in HR_LOCATIONS, the validations are based on the PAY ... payroll tables populated by Vertex Data with a full install of HR
        For HR_LOCATIONS_ALL (applies to Legal Entity Addresses and Internal Location Addresses)
            DFF is 'Location Address' and seeded styles (DFF contexts) 'US' (the seeded style for HR) and 'US_GLB' (the seeded Global/International Style)
            If HR is not fully installed, the validations on 'US' style will cause data entry failures because the tables are empty
                Tables referenced in validation sets for style 'US' are:
                    PAY_US_CITY_NAMES
                    PAY_US_COUNTIES
                    PAY_US_STATES
                    PAY_US_CITY_GEOCODES
                    PAY_US_COUNTIES
                    PAY_US_ZIP_CODES
                    PAY_US_CITY_SCHOOL_DSTS
                    PAY_US_COUNTY_SCHOOL_DSTS
            You cannot choose the style when entering a Legal Entity Address
                Oracle chooses the first valid style ('US')
                If HR is not fully installed you can disable this style in the DFF context, or remove the validation set references
                    or, replace the validation sets with newly defined sets which reference HZ_GEOGRAPHIES
                        which guarantees the LOV's used to enter addresses match the validation values used in geography validation
            References
                How to Setup a Legal Address Using HR Address Formats in R12 Legal Entity Configurator (Doc ID 1104887.1)  end-to-end description of defining, choosing or modifying a style to meet local needs. Also describes creating a custom validation set against HZ_GEOGRAPHIES  so that the list of valid values  setting up an address is the same list used to validate it for tax purposes.
                Can you use the US Address Style in a Shared HR Environment? (Doc ID 1610796.1) recommends disabling the US style so that Oracle uses US_GLB instead (since the US style is intended for a full implementation of HR and a full load of the Vertex HR geography patch
                Can the US Address Style be Disabled? (Doc ID 1394466.1) also recommends disabling the US style if on Shared HRMS and not the full HRMS/Payroll system
                What is the Difference Between The Two Address Forms PERACADR (North American Address) and PERWSADR (Generic Address) (Doc ID 954512.1)  a somewhat related note describing the purpose of the two styles  US is for HR/Payroll.
                No Values In City/County LOV When Creating Legal Address In Legal Entity Manager (Doc ID 1259396.1)  recommends removing the validation sets on the US address style but continuing to use the US address style instead of disabling it.
        For HZ_LOCATIONS (applies to suppliers, customers, bank branches and freight carriers etc)
            DFF is 'Address' and seeded style (dff context) 'POSTAL_ADDR_US'
                'POSTAL_ADDR_US' is similar in design to 'US' on the HR_LOCATIONS_ALL table but without country
                    This is because Country is the context used to link the style in AR setups (Receivables > Setups > System > Countries > (Query for 'United States')
    Tip: Message 'Skipped GNR - transaction exists for this location' validating HZ_LOCATIONS can occur
        This is governed by AR System Option (not profile option) 'Allow change to printed transaction'
            If this option is set, the GNR error will be suppressed but changes will be allowed to printed transactions
    Tip: You must set up a default address style before defining validations for additional address styles
        The default style will be applied to validate addresses for any address style, or no style
            This handles the situation where multiple address styles exist (e.g. conversion vs. new data)
        Optionally add validations for additional address styles but this is only needed if the structures differ from the default styles.
        This ensures that validation can be performed on any address in a chosen geography
        It applies to each table: HZ_LOCATIONS and HR_LOCATIONS_ALL

    Address Styles
        Validations can be set for multiple address styles

        Each customer or supplier address is validated based on the rules for the entered address style
    Geography Validation
        Geography Validation only applies to the HZ_LOCATIONS table so the Geography Validation Control is only visible for this table
        Geography Validation is used to validate addresses when they are entered into the application
        The Geography Validation checkbox at each geography level determines if the field is required for entry
        The Geography Validation Control box selects the type of validation that is applied in Geography Validation
            Error - full validation is performed and all mandatory fields must have values
                Invalid values in non-mandatory fields will throw errors when geo name referencing is run
                The field heading in 'Geography Mapping and Validations' is set to 'Geography Validation' to indicate which fields are validated
            Mandatory Fields Only - only fields checked as mandatory must be filled in and they can be invalid
                Mandatory fields are determined by which address attributes are checked for 'Mandatory'
                The field heading in 'Geography Mapping and Validations' changes to 'Mandatory' to indicate the mandatory address levels
            No Validation - all addresses are accepted whether valid or not
            Warning - invalid addresses are saved after a warning
            When you change the Geography Validation Control from 'Error' to 'Mandatory', the column heading for validation changes from 'Geography Validation' to 'Mandatory'
    Tax Validation
        Tax Validation is applied to transactions
        Only transactions with valid addresses for tax purposes will be considered in Tax Calcuations
        Each field marked as part of tax validation is considered valid on transactions for tax
    Geography Name Referencing Program
        Tip: AR System Profile 'Allow Changes to Printed Transactions' may cause 'Skipped GNR' messages in the log file
            This option locks addresses from update if there are transactions on the location and the line type is 'TAX' on the AR invoice line
        Geography validation is not case sensitive for attributes like County and City
        Run this program to validate addresses in HR_LOCATIONS_ALL or HZ_LOCATIONS
            Set the parameter 'Run Type' to 'All Records', previous 'Errors' or 'New' records never previously validated
            Set the parameter 'Address Usage' to 'Tax' or 'Geography' to choose the applicable validation configuration a validation address style
        Tables involved in the procees are
            HZ_GEO_NAME_REFERENCE_LOG - lists 'S' Success or 'E' Error in the MAP_STATUS field after each run
            HZ_GEO_NAME_REFERENCES
        This program only inserts values under the new concurrent request id if there is a change of status
            Query the table based on location_id to see the current status ('S' or 'E') and the concurrent request under which this was originally set
            If tax and geography are being validated, expect two lines with different USAGE_CODES (TAX or GEOGRAPHY)

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes on Tax Inclusive Processing
    Taxes are not inclusive in the US for Sales Tax (i.e. they are charged as separate line items)
        For Excise taxes, the tax is inclusive and not separately charged.
    Tax inclusive handling is set at several levels in the model:
        1. Regime level
        2. Tax level
        3. Tax rate level (on rate details)
        4. Party level 1 - First Party Legal Entity
        5. Party level 2 - First Party Legal Establishment (within Tax Registration)

    Accounts defined at the tax level default to the tax rate level and can be over-ridden at the tax rate level
        The primary account is the tax liability account, labeled 'Tax Recoverable/Liability'
            This is the main liability account where owed taxes are accrued for later payment
    General Tax accounts include:
        1. Tax Expense (not required)

        Cannot Validate Self-Assessed Invoice [ID 605345.1]
    Basic Procedure (applies only to AP transactions - not purchasing or receivables which are unaffected by these setting)
        Default the Registration Rule to 'Bill From' - all taxes will not self assess
        Establish 'Not Registered' registrations for unregistered suppliers
        Enable the internal Legal Establishment for Self Assessment and Create a Registration to the Regime
        Create an overrding registration rule pointing to 'Bill To' is the supplier is unregistered
            Registrations must be jurisdiction-specific
    Basic Reverse Procedure (applies only to AP transactions - not purchasing or receivables)
        Default the Registration Rule to 'Bill To' (or 'Ship To/Bill To)
        Establish 'Registered' registrations for registered suppliers
        Enable the internal Legal Establishment for Self Assessment and create a Registration to the Regime
        Create an overriding registration rule pointing to 'Bill From' if the supplier is registered
            Registrations must be jurisdiction-specific
    Keep in mind
        Self assessment won't work if the Legal Establishment is not enabled for self assessment and has no registration to the regime
        Supplier registrations are not needed for suppliers to prevent self-assessment
            Self Assessment is driven by the registration rule looking to the Legal Establishment which is registered to the regime and enabled for self-assessment
            Taxes will calculate as non-self-assessed on suppliers with no registration records but there will be no registration number on the tax line record
        If the legal establishment is not registered to the regime the tax will not self assess regardless of other settings
    How it Works
        Self-Assessment only applies to purchases and not to sales so the configuration is purchasing/payables specific
        Oracle uses these things to determine self-assessment
            The 'Existance' of tax registration records on legal establishments (self-assessment will not set if there is no valid registration for the regime)
            The 'Set for Self Assessment/Reverse Charge' flag must be set on the First Party Legal Establishment
                This setting can be on the legal entity, legal establishment or individual registrations for each regime within the establishment
                The individual regime registration settings of this flag drive processsing - the other levels are defaults
            A default tax rule (registration type) or override rule that sets the registration party as the ship-to (e.g. if the supplier is not registered)
        The Self-Assessment flag must be enabled on the Legal Establishment Tax Profile and child registrations
            Note this flag can be set on the legal entity, legal establishment and individual tax registration records
                It needs to be enabled on the legal establishment tax registration record - other levels are default
        A registration record does not have to exist on the supplier to calculate tax
        The purpose of a supplier registration is to track their registration number info and to support a rule to point back to the Legal Establishment for self assessment
        However a registration record and corresponding registration rule are needed to override the default and point to the internal establishment
            Eg. Default Registration rule 'Bill From' - tax will calculate as not self assessed
                No supplier registrations unless the supplier is specifically 'not registered'
                For suppliers specifically 'not registered' a registration record and rule based on the record to point to the establishment as the registered party
            It doesn't matter how the Tax Registration Status value is set within the registration record (Registered, Not Registered, Agent, or Custom)
                What matters is the 'existance' of the registration record and the effective date range of the registration record
                The flag 'Set for Self Assessment/Reverse Charge' enables or disables self-assessment on the party pointed to by the tax rule
                    If the tax registration rule points to the supplier and the supplier has no registration but the supplier has the Self Assessment/Reverse Charge Flag set, it will self-assess
                    If the tax registration rule points to the first party legal establishment and the Self Assessment/Reverse Charge Flag is set, it will self-assess
    You enable self assessment by the check box 'Set for Self Assessment/Reverse Charge' on the First Party Legal Establishment Tax Profile
        You can enable self assessment at different levels based on the setup of the Registration Record
            You can limit the registration record to a Tax or Tax Jurisdiction Level
            Registration settings at lower levels override settings at higher levels
    There is a self-assessment flag on the Supplier also, at the Supplier level
        The Self-Assess flag at the supplier level is not needed to enable self-assessment
        If this is set then the transaction will be set to self-assessment if the rule is defined to use the supplier registration and not the first party
    Enable self assessment with the 'Set for Self Assessment/Reverse Charge' option by updating the First Party Legal Entity and Establishment Records
        Do this on the Party Tax Profile for the internal Legal Entity, Legal Establishment or Operating Unit (if the Operating Unit is subscribed to the regime directly)
        Navigation: Tax Manager/Party Tax Profiles/<Choose Legal Entity>/Create Tax Profile
    Each supplier has a flag at the supplier level 'Set for Self Assessment/Reverse Charge' which must be enabled
        If this option is not set, you cannot manually force self-assessment on the Tax Details of a transaction
        You can set the flag for it, but it won't save this way and will recalculate with tax on the invoice

Tax Engine (ZX) Schema Notes on Fiscal Classifications
    Reference: E-Business Tax User Guide
    Several fiscal classifications can be optionally defined as country-specific
        This limits their availability on transactions to matching 'Taxation Countries' on the transaction
    Fiscal Classifications include three 'types'
        Party Fiscal Classifications - such as special vendor classifications (e.g. not for profit)
        Product Fiscal Classifications - based on inventory item groups
        Product Categories - based on non-inventory classifications
        Intended Use Fiscal Classifications
        Business Categories
        Transaction Fiscal Classifications - for example a give-away or disposal sale - these are assigned to Business Categories
        User Defined Transaction Fiscal Classifications
    They are assigned at run-time to determine if tax rules apply
    Fiscal classifications are optional on transactions
    Party Fiscal Classifications - assigned to suppliers and their tax registrations
        Fiscal Classifications are assigned to Regimes and Countries
        Party Fiscal Classifications group parties into different tax status groups
        TCA Groups are used to set party fiscal classifications for tax handling purposes
        Examples are: Distributer, Consumer, Not for Profit
        Party Fiscal Classifications can be used to apply different tax treatment to suppliers or customers
    Product Fiscal Classifications are inventory based product classifications
        They are based on An Oracle Inventory Category Set
        The product fiscal classification is defaulted on the line based on the inventory item
        If no item is entered they can be recorded manually in the Product Fiscal Classification field
    Product Category (non-inventory based)
        These values must be entered on the transaction line (invoice or purchase order) in the Product Category field
        They can be multi-segment or single segment - fixed at implementation time
        They are created by adding to the existing seeded categories in: Tax Managers > Products > Product Classifications > Product Category > (add subcomponents)
    Intended Use (for inventory and non-inventory)
        Intended Use is tied to the inventory category or non-inventory category
        This assignment is set at implementation time and cannot be changed
        Intended use applies where the same item is taxed differently based on use
        An example is off-road/on-road dieses
        Another example is project management as intangible or tangible (constructing an asset)
        They are created in: Tax Managers > Products > Intended Use Classifications
    Business Categories are seeded values and include the following values:
            Expense Report
            Purchase Pre-Payment
            Purchase
            Sale
            Sales Adjustment

            Once created, they can be associated to Transaction Fiscal Classifications for use in tax rules
                They can be assigned to transactions at the header and line levels in the 'Business Category' field
                The value in the Business Category Field show the full hierarchical path for each value

        These are not the same as User Defined Fiscal Classification Codes - see below
        These values are defined and assigned to Business Categories (as subclassifications) and not entered on transactions directly
        Hierarchies are supported with multiple segment values
        You can define a Transaction Fiscal Classification and assign it to multiple Business Categories
            This allows a single rule which applies to multiple Business Categories
    Document Fiscal Classifications
        Document Fiscal Classifications are intended to classify transactions according to special tax documentation that must accompany transactions (e.g. export approvals)
        They are entered on the Document Sub Type field on PO's (in the Additional Tax Information page and on the AP Invoice on the invoice header as 'Invoice Subtype'
            The value on the PO does not default to the invoice because it is stored on the shipment level on PO's (in ZX.ZX_LINES_DET_FACTORS) and on the invoice header

Tax Engine (ZX) Schema Notes on Tax Registrations
    Reference: Setting Up a Tax Registration, Tax Users Guide pp 3-10
    Tax Registrations are assigned to first and third party tax profiles
    They define a parties obligation to pay taxes to a taxing authority (Nexus)
    Tax registrations are also used in tax reporting
        Navigation: Tax Manager/Party Tax Profiles/<Choose Third Party or Site>/Create Tax Registration
    Each tax registration on a party or party site is tagged with multiple attributes
        A tax regime
        A tax jurisdiction for the tax registration
        A tax for the tax registration indicating which tax (i.e. tax type) it applies to
        The supplier's 'Company Reporting Name'
        Tax Registration Type - is used for reporting purposes
            There are seeded values for Argentina only and are used to validate tax number
            Tax registration types define how the tax registration number is built and validated
        Tax Registration Number - assigned to the supplier by the tax authority
            The Tax Registration Number can be validated if it is based on build rules and types
        Legal Registration Address of the supplier
        Registration Status: Agent, Registered, Not Registered
            Registration Status is used as a determining factor in tax rules
        Explicit or Implicit Registration -
            An explicit registration is an officially issued registration
            An implicit registration deems a suppiler to be registered based on their level of business
        Tax Authority issuing the registration
        Registration Reason - used to further define implicit registrations
        Effective Dates
        Invoice Controls - these default from the party level and can be overridden here
        Bank Accounts of the registration for the supplier (if required on reports)
        Reporting and Collecting Tax Authorities
             These default from the jurisdiction but can be over-ridden here

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes on Tax Registration Processing
    Reference: EBusiness Tax User Guide R12 - p 6-10 Determine Tax Registration
    Registrations determine the registration number, dates and details applicable to a party
        They also drive self assessment, inclusive tax and tax rounding processing
    A registration is required for the first party legal entity
    A registration is optional for the third party entity (at the entity or site level)
    Tax registrations can be set as the default value on the registration attached to first party establishments
    They can also be set on suppliers and customers
    Two tax registrations are stamped onto each tax transaction
        1. The first party registration of the first party legal entity
        2. The tax registration derived from the 'Determine Tax Registration' rule
    The registration derived from the tax rule is used to drive tax reporting and handling
        It uses the information from the tax registration derived from the tax rule for the following attributes:
            1. Tax Inclusive Handling
            2. Self Assessment/Reverse Charge/Use Tax
            3. Tax amount rounding
    Tax rules drive the tax registration that is used to report tax on a transaction
        In the US SUTA regime, registrations should first check the supplier
        If the supplier is not registered than the first party establishment registration should be used (US SUTA only)
    When registrations are attached to parties, they can be attached with multiple optional attributes
        1. Regime
        2. Tax
        3. Jurisdiction
        If attached with these attributes, the registration is identifed first at the jurisdiction level, next at the tax level and lastly at the regime level
        If a registration is applied at the regime level it applies to all taxes and jurisdictions

    Taxes for Different Purchase Order Types
        Taxes are calculated on requisitions and standard purchase orders
        They are not calculated on Blanket Purchase Orders but they are calculated on Releases
            You cannot configure a Blanket Purchase Order for tax (there is no ship-to information)
    Tax information defaults onto PO's, Requisitions and Releases if eBTax is setup
        Taxes normally apply at the shipment level of a purchase order or release and the line level of a requisition
    You can view tax on purchase orders and requisitions or releases window once the PO or Requisition is saved
        This can also be done at the lines and distributions windows
        Navigation: Tools (or Actions) -> Manage Taxes
        A requisition or PO must be saved before tax calculation is fired
    You can view tax on iProcurement requisitions in the final step (Review and Submit) of requistion creation
        Open the details of the requisition and click on the Tax Details option
    You can change the tax on a purchase order shipment line via the Forms PO maintenance screen
        Navigation: Tools (or Actions) -> Manage Taxes > Tax > Additonal Tax Information > (Update and apply)
            Updates are made only in the 'Additional Tax Information' window
        The profile option: "eBTax: Allow Override of Tax Classification Code" must be enabled
        Taxes are calculated on requisition lines and po shipment level lines
        Changes to tax driving attributes on a PO recalculate tax when the PO is saved
            If the PO is incomplete you have to complete the PO and submit for approval to see the new tax
            Taxes are always calculated when a PO is submitted for approval
    You can override the recoverable vs. non-recoverable amount on a purchase order in the 'Recovery Rate' field on PO Distribution lines
        This field and all other tax-related fields are frozen if receipts have been recorded against the purchase order
    PO Taxes are applied to the invoice when it is matched to the PO
        If the option 'Enforce Tax from Reference Document' is enabled on Configuration Tax Options (for the Payables > Standard Invoice subscription)
            References
                What is the Meaning of the Enforce Tax From Reference Object Flag in AP? (Doc ID 1510891.1)
            The tax status and tax rate on the PO is placed on the Invoice and any changes are accounted as a second tax variance line
            Variances can be
                TERV - Tax Exchange Rate Variance
                TIPV - Tax Invoice Price Tax Rate Variance
                TRV - Tax Rate Variance
                TQV - Tax Quantity Variance (shown as a non-variance distribution)

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes on Payables Integration
    Reference: Payables User Guide 12.0 pp 3-182 Taxes on Invoices
    When you enter an invoice and click 'Calculate Taxes' in Payables, eBTax is invoked to calculate taxes
        The total tax is updated on the invoice header
        If the tax is self assessed, it appears on the 'Self Assessed Tax Amount' field on the invoice header
            This field is for reference only - it does not modify the amount due from the supplier
            Self assessed tax distributions are not visible through the invoice - only distributions that are part of the invoice amount are viewable
            If you update a tax line to be self assessed, it is included in the self assessed total and removed from distributions
            To report on self-assessed taxes, use the following Subledger Accounting reports:
                Account Analysis Report, Subledger Accounting Implementation Guide
                Open Account Balanced Listing, Oracle Subledger Accounting Implementation Guide
    Taxes that are not inclusive are generated as separate lines on the invoice (exclusive lines)
            The tax amounts are shown as a summarized line with separate distribution lines for each tax
        Inclusive taxes are generated as amounts in the inclusive tax amount field on the existing invoice line
    Taxes are recalculated during invoice validation and put on hold if tax related issues are found
    'Tax Only' lines are tax lines not related to any other line on the invoice
        They may be the only line on the invoice - created to process a tax transaction on its own.
    Manual tax lines can be entered on an invoice
    The tax engine does not provide tax services for withholding taxes or 1099 reporting
    Supplier tax profiles are maintained in the Tax Engine and not in Payable
        Navigation: Tax Manager/Party Tax Profiles/<Choose Third Party or Site>/Create Tax Profile
        Options exist at the supplier level and the supplier registration level
        Supplier level Options include:
            Allow Tax Applicability - to automatically calculate taxes for this supplier

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes on Offset Taxes
    Reference: 1312671.1 Offset Tax Codes Also Display in Tax Classification LOV
    Reference: 1104163.1 Oracle E-Business Suite 12.1 Financeials Pre-Upgrade, Setup, and Operational Tips (includes Offset Tax introduction)
    Reference: http://www.orastudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/OracleEBusinessSuiteR12.1FinancialsPreUpgradeSetupandOperationalTips.pdf
    Offset Taxes are used to undo taxes charged on supplier invoices and accrue them as self assessed taxes
        They differ from self assessed taxes (use taxes) because the create journal entries to transfer the taxes to an accrual account from the supplier tax journal
           Use taxes replace the original supplier tax charge rather than creating a second tax line
    With an offset tax, the original supplier tax is recorded from the invoice to reconcile to the invoice header
        A second negative amount offset tax is added automatically by Oracle and charged to an offset tax
    Offset Taxes will only calculate if the supplier is enabled for Offset Taxes in their Tax Profile
    Offset Taxes must also be enabled on the event class subscription and on the tax definition

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes on Tax Rules
    Tax rules have defaults and specific rules - the rules are tested first and the defaults applied last
    Rules are specific to a regime and tax - they must be repeated for every additional regime and tax
    Certain tax rule types or defaults are required (e.g. Determine Place of Supply)
    Tax rules have several different types that are evaluated in a specific order:
    1. Determine Place of Supply - where the goods transfered from seller to buyer for tax purposes (point of delivery or 'use' in the US)
    2. Determine Tax Applicability - determines if the tax under which this rule is written in applicable
    3. Determine Tax Registration - determines which tax registration will be used on the transaction (e.g. the supplier's?)
    4. Determine Taxable Basis - the underlying value or measure upon which the tax will be calculated
    5. Determine Tax Status - requird before determining tax rates since tax rate rules are specific to a single status
    6. Determine Tax Rate - each tax rate rule is specific to a tax and tax status determined earlier

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes on Formulas
    Formulas are used in a number of places including tax rules (e.g. STANDARD_TB is the rule for taxable basis)
    There are seeded formulas and user-defined formulas are allows
    Navigation: Tax Manager -> Advanced Setup Options -> Tax Formulas
    Change the tax basis using a formula and base rate modified
        Reference: Tax User Guide and search on 'Base Rate Modifier'
        Create a formula with type 'Taxable Basis' and basis type 'Line Amount' and enter a percentage base rate modifier
            e.g. -10 will reduce the taxable basis by 10%, +10 will increase the tax basis by 10%

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes Determining Factor Sets and Condition Sets
    Navigation: Tax Manager -> Advanced Setup Options -> Determining Factor Sets
    Determining factor sets are collections of factors used in rules and assigned a single (group) name
    Determining condition sets are specific to factor sets and have values for the determining factors
        It is not possible to use a condition set on a determining factor set other than the set to which is was originally defined
    A combination of a determining factor set and condition set represents a complete rule which can point to a result (tax rate)
    Only one determining factor set can be used on a single tax rule
        If more than one determining factor set is required on tax rules, additional rules should be defined

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Tax Migration from 11i to R12
    Migration uses the Direct Tax Determination Method and the STCC (Standard Tax Classification Codes) in an upgrade
        Each Tax Code is migrated as a Tax Classification in R12
    One Tax Rule (type 'Direct Tax Determination Method) is created for each Tax Group in 11i
        If no Tax Groups are defined in 11i then no rules are created and they have to be built manually
    The Determining Factor Set is created as STCC (Standard Tax Classification Codes)
        One Condition Set is created with a condition for each Tax Classification
    A regime determination set "Standard Tax Classification Codes" is attached to each Event Subscription in Configuration Owner Tax Options
        If STCC is not to be used but the full tax model is to be used, the Regime Determination Set is set to 'Determine Applicable Regime'
    One new tax is created for every unique tax code in 11i (if multiple date effective records exist only one new tax is created)
        A new tax rate is created for every date-effective record in 11i
        If a tax code in 11i is end-dated and only one value exists, it is created as a single tax code with one date effective rate (end-dated)
    R12 Tax Names are converted from 11i Tax Names by removing the numbers and special characters and adding the Tax Type as a suffix
    R12 Tax Rates are created in R12 from the 11i Tax Name without any changes
    Tax Classification Codes on the Supplier Site in 11i are migrated to Tax Classification Codes on Party Tax Profiles for Third Party Sites in ebTax
        They are no longer maintained via the Supplier Site Maintenance page
    In a standard upgrade the flag 'Allow Tax Override' is not set by default (potentially) so you don't get a list of values in Tax Rate for manual entry

        Which one is more advantageous to setup, rules or tax exceptions to indicate that certain products (or prod. classifications) have a tax exception? (Doc ID 422689.1)
    Exemptions are party specific and exceptions are product specific
        Exemptions are for parties and allow you to exempt parties from tax on all transactions
            Exemptions require exemption certificates issued by the government authorities
            Exemptions must be defined at the party-specific owner level and not the global level - per regime subscription options
            Exemptions can be specific to an item and inventory organization or global for all items
            Exemptions setup at site level only apply to ship-to addresses on customers
                Exemptions setup at party/customer level apply to bill-to addresses
            Exemption Status of 'manual' requires the exemption to be entered on the transaction with a matching exemption reason
            Exemption Status of 'Primary' automatically applies to the transaction
            Navigation: Tax Manager > Parties > Party Tax Profiles > Third Party > Exemptions
        Exceptions allow you to setup a specific tax for a product and this rate applies globally
            They are setup on items and product fiscal classifications
            Use product tax exceptions for special rates based on product fiscal classifications rather than defining a Determine Tax Rate rule based on product fiscal classifications.
                For example, if three out of five product fiscal classifications use a special rate, define three product tax exceptions based on the three product fiscal classifications that need a special rate, and set the standard rate as the default rate.

        The event class subscription must be set to allow exemptions otherwise they will not apply

            Exemptions cannot be shared across legal entities because they are issued to legal entities specifically
        Exemptions can also be setup as zero rates under alternative tax statuses
        For US SUTA, charitable organizations and law firms are not exempt from tax but their services are exempt
            This applies to an exempt tax status rather than a customer based exemption
        Attachment functionality is not enabled for exemptions (e.g. inline attachments to store registration scanned documents)

Tax Engine (ebTax ZX Schema) Notes on Application Tax Options
    Reference: E-Business Tax User Guide 2-41 'Using Application Tax Options'
    Application Tax Options are used to migrate legacy tax codes from 11i
    They set the precedence rules previously available in 11i for stamping a tax code on a transaction line
    They should not be setup in 12i unless the instance is an upgrade and the new features of 12i will not be used
    Tax rules are still required to drive tax handling based on the legacy tax codes if this feature is used.
    Disabling migrated hierarchy rules is permanent.

        Background
            Vertex remains privately owned and offers the Q-Series and O-Series applications.
            Vertex ORAMAST is a jurisdiction and rate load file into Oracle
                It does not handle capped taxes in Tennessee and Florida (max taxes)
                It does handle sellers use tax in Missouri (rate for interstate supplies is lower than in-state supplies)
            Both O and Q do the same thing but Q is older, simpler to implement and does not have rates for special districts
                Q is built on zip code level detail
                O is built on geocode level detail and handles special jurisdictions
            There is no automated upgrade patch from Q to O - the underlying architectures are different
            Vertex have sales tax, consumer use tax (use tax in-state) and seller use tax (use tax across state lines)
                There are some rate differences between sales, use and seller use tax due to out of state taxing rules (e.g. local taxes are excluded)
            O Series has many issues

        Overview
            Approach
                Everything is taxable unless otherwise exempted
            Taxability Categories
                Mapped from Oracle Attributes: GL Account, Expenditure Type, Item, Item Cateogory
            Taxability Drivers
                Taxability drivers are attributes of transactions (GL Expense Accounts, Cost Centers, Purchasing Categories, Expenditure Types)
                Source drivers (from EBS) map to Taxability Codes (a normalized list of taxability codes in Vertex)
                Taxability Codes are mapped to Taxability Category ID's (internal Vertex codes maintained by Vertex)
                Taxability Category ID's map to geographies for the correct tax rate
                Taxability Categories and geographies are maintained by Vertex
                Taxability Drivers and Taxability Codes are maintained by Oracle users

                Hierarchy for each transaction type of taxability rules to apply
                Comprises
                    Precalculation - modifies data before tax rules are applied
                        Examples (set values for Purchase, PurchaseClass, Usage, UsageClass, EntityName, GeneralLedgerAccount, Division)
                        IF ((FLEX.input.MINOR=) AND (FLEX.input.SOURCE=)) AND (LOOKUP ( PO_GL_Exempt, generalLedgerAccount) = Y) SET purchase  TO "Y" -- no item category and account is exempt, so exempt
                        IF (FLEX.input.PO_NUM=) AND (LOOKUP ( GL_ExpenseExempt , generalLedgerAccount) = Y) SET purchase TO Y -- no PO number and account is exempt so exempt
                        IF (projectNumber=) AND (FLEX.input.PO_NUM=) SET purchase.purchaseClass TO generalledgerAccount -- not a project or purchase order so use account rule
                        IF (FLEX.input.MINOR<>) AND (FLEX.input.SOURCE<>) SET purchase.purchaseClass TO LOOKUP (Source_to_GL, FLEX.input.MINOR, FLEX.input.SOURCE) -- item category so use category exemptions
                        IF (projectNumber<>) AND (LOOKUP ( Exempt_Expenditure_Type , FLEX.input.EXPND_TYPE) = Y) SET purchase TO Y -- project with exempt expenditure type
                        IF (projectNumber<>) AND (FLEX.input.EXPND_TYPE<>) SET purchase TO LOOKUP (EXPENDITURE_MAPPINGS , FLEX.input.EXPND_TYPE) -- set expenditure type
                        IF costCenter<> SET usage TO LOOKUP (CostCenter_To_Usage, costCenter) -- non-null cost center to map cost center to usage
                        IF FLEX.input.LEGAL_ENT<> null SET FLEX.input.EntityName TO LOOKUP (Legal Entity Name Lookup, FLEX.input.LEGAL_ENT) -- set legal entity
                        IF (project.NUM<>) AND (FLEX.input.EXPND_TYPE<>) SET usage TO p -- set usage to Project
                        IF (projectNumber <>) AND (FLEX.input.EXPND_TYPE<>) SET generalLedgerAccount TO  LOOKUP ( EXPENDITURE_MAPPINGS , FLEX.input.EXPND_TYPE) -- map GL account for project
                        IF FLEX.input.LEGAL_ENT<> null SET buyer.division TO FLEX.input.LEGAL_ENT
                        IF buyer.division = 1100 SET buyer.division TO 1101
                    Postcalculation - modifies data before results of tax rules are returned to oracle
                    Lookup Tables - used by precalculation and postcalculation rules to map data

The Use Tax Liability Report is ported from 11i but does not support R12 Tax reporting
        It only reports migrated Use Tax types from 11i
        There is no corresponding report available in R12 to report use tax liabilities at transaction level
    The Tax Register report covers AR transactions and is used to review tax liabilities
        Parameters allow a choice between current and deferred liabilities
    The Financial Tax Register Report shows the output of the Tax Reporting Ledger
    Both the Tax Register and Financial Tax Register populate the tax register view ZX_REP_EXTRACT_V
        The process 'Financial Tax Register' must be run to populate this view
    Financial Tax Register
        Components
            RX-Only: Financial Tax Register Report - this component generates the data
            Financial Tax Register - this component is submitted and subsequently formats returned data
        The Financial Tax Register covers GL, AP and AR transactions
        How the Tax Reporting Ledger works
            Job "Financial Tax Register" is submitted and calls "RX-Only: Financial Tax Register Report"
            Job "RX-Only: Financial Tax Register Report" selects data from the base tables and populates four temporary tables
            The Tax Reporting view ZX_REP_EXTRACT_V holds tax reporting data from GL/AP/PO for RXi based reports
            The view is populated from AP/PO from ZX_LINES via ZX_REP_TRX_DETAIL_T (a temp table)
            Intermediate tables populated prior to RXi output are:
                ZX_REP_CONTEXT_T
                ZX_REP_TRX_DETAIL_T
                ZX_REP_TRX_JX_EXT_T
                ZX_REP_ACTG_EXT_T
            These tables are not purged if FND DEBUG is enabled
            Query these tables for a specific request_id to see the lines applicable to the request
            It must be run with the Register Type: 'Tax Register' as the parameter set to see AP transactions
        Parameters
            Attribute Set
                TAXREG -  includes AR, AP and PO data but not discount amounts for AR and GL
                Default - contains all attributes from the extract view
                Use TAXREG for debugging initially since Default may not work
                Running the report with 'Default' as the parameter set will only show AR transactions
            Register Type:
                Tax Register - transactions from the Collected tax accounts
                    The Interim Tax option only reports taxes from receivables, not payables
                Interim Tax Register - transactions from the interim tax accounts
                Non-Recoverable - transactions from the non-recoverable tax accounts
        General Rules
            The following parameter values are required during report submission to display accounting information
                  Summary Level = Transaction Distribution
                  Include Accounting Segments = Yes
                  Accounting Status = Accounted or Both Accounted and Unaccounted
              See MOS Note 1305895.1 for supporting guidelines
        Troubleshooting
           Enable debug to freeze the contents of the temporary tables so results are not deleted
    Reporting is custom: XML Publisher, RXi (Assets) and Oracle Reports
        Standard templates are available for XML Publisher

    Open Questions
        How is data purged from ZX_REP_EXTRACT_V by purging ZX_REP_TRX_DETAIL_T and other temp tables?
            To report on self-assessed taxes, use the following Subledger Accounting reports (from AP responsibility):
                Account Analysis Report (XLAAARPT) (*), see Subledger Accounting Implementation Guide pp 8-20
                    Drill down information on the activity on an account.
                    XLAAARPT is referenced to the Subledger Accounting application in foundation
                Open Account Balanced Listing (XLATBRPT)(*), see Oracle Subledger Accounting Implementation Guide pp 9-1
            This is a summary report only, by account
                    Identifies accounts with balances and the sources of those entries
                    XLATBRPT is references in the Subledger Accounting application in foundation
                    The Open Account Balances Listing is defined in AP (Setup/Accounting Setup/Subledger Setup/Open Account Balances Listing)
            This establishes the 'Report Definition' which is a parameter in the listing

Transfer Pricing Notes
    Definitions
        Marginal Cost - cost of producing or manufacturing an additional unit
        Absorption Cost - the fully absorbed cost of producting a unit
        Standard Cost - a predefined 'budgeted' cost of production

    Pricing Approaches
        Cost Based - a markup over the cost (based on marginal, absorption or standard)
        Market Based - the price that could be obtained in the open market

    General Notes
        Transfer pricing must observe national laws for taxes on sales
            It cannot be set artificially low to avoid local taxes

Treasury (XTR) Responsibilities
    TREASURY, VISION OPERATIONS (TVO)
    TREASURY/CASH MANAGEMENT, VISION OPERATIONS (TCMVO)

Treasury (XTR) Notes:
    Oracle Treasury is a new application for Oracle 11i and is a subledger application to the GL
    The two purposes of Oracle Treasury are to raise long term capital, and provide short term funding or invest short term funds from operations to maximize interest income
    Treasury obtains information from AP on scheduled payments, AR on expected receipts, PAY on expected payments.
    A portfolio in Treasury is a collection of individual deals or trades.
    A position is a total commitment to a particular market, equal to the number or value of contracts bought, less the number of contracts sold
    The company profile is used to relate contracts to a set of books, legal entity, a bank account and employees responsible for opening and settling deals
    Counterparties to deals can be internal (subsidiaries) or external (banks and brokerages)
    Deals captured by Treasury include spot, forward, futures, swaps, short term money, intercompany funding, negotiable instruments, and derivatives
    Treasury maintains interest rates in XTR_MARKET_PRICES which is separate to the interest rates maintained
        GL_DAILY_RATES and Treasury uses its internal rates for tolerance checks and revaluations
    Treasury bank accounts are separate to AP bank accounts, and are maintained in XTR_BANK_ACCOUNTS
    Exercise: Setup company profile -> TVO/Setup/Parties/Company Profiles, and set up profiles for each company or operating unit
    Exercise: Setup counterparties -> TVO/Setup/Parties/Counterparty Profiles

Treasury (XTR) Interfaces:
    Market Data Feed, imports foreign exchange rates, interest rates, bond prices and option volatilities, via XTR_MARKET_DATA_INTERFACE

Warehouse Management System (OWM or WMS) Notes:
    Warehouses are defined through the Organizations form as Orgs with type = Inventory Organization (subinventories are zones within a warehouse complex)
    OWM transactions include: receiving, putaway, backflush, kanban replenishment, cross-docking, completions, picking, loading, ship confirm, zone transfer
    UOM Classes group units of measure that can be converted into one another. Each UOM class has a base UOM.
    Examples are UOM classes are: quantity, volume, temperature
    Each item has a primary UOM - on-hand quantities are maintained in the primary UOM.
    You must define a conversion to the base UOM to use a UOM on an item
    Transaction Source Types - are transaction types of the source of material transactions (eg PO is the source type for a PO receipt)
    Transaction Actions - identify the nature of the material transaction (eg receipt into stores).
        Joined with transaction source type to define the transaction (eg PO/Receipt into Stores = PO Receipt)
    Transaction Types - represent the combination of tran source types and transaction actions.
    Transaction Reasons - are tagged to a transaction that cannot be performed, and may trigger an associated workflow (eg insufficient inventory to pick)
    Subinventory in OWM simply means zone - there is no implicit definition of accounts for a subinventory.
        Cost group associations define the accounts.
    Cost Groups - collection of valuation and variance accounts tied to a subinventory (originally the accounts were individually tied to the subinventory but OWM separated these)
    Material Statuses include a list of disallowed transactions - the status can be attached to a lot or serial item to prevent these transactions occuring.
    Miscellaneous transactions allow transfer between inventory and non-inventory departments like research or accounting.
        The transfer is to/from GL accounts
    Mass moves and mass issues from the Materials Workbench move all materials in a subinventory in one transaction
    Direct shipment mode on an inter-org transfer moves items to their destination directly,
        whereas intransit mode moves items to an intermediate account pending delivery
    Estimated arrival dates for in-transits can be updated on the 'Maintain Shipments' window
    Move orders are requests or nominations to move material rather than actual immediate movements. Entered via 'Create Move Orders' form
    Move orders can perform subinventory transfers, pick waves for shipping, replenishments, and pick release to WIP.
    Pick wave move orders for shipping are created automatically when sales order lines are released for picking.
    Move orders are 'transacted' to actualize.
    Lots are groups of items with similar characteristics - you can classify output from production batches into lots with similar properties
    Lot attributes can be numeric, descriptive or date. Attributes are primarily dates: use by, made on, matures for use on, retest required on, etc.
    Lots can be split into multiple new lots: full split eliminates the parent and leaves children. Partial split leaves a smaller parent and new children
    Lots can be merged fully or partially: full merge eliminates the originating lots whereas partial merge leaves a portion.
        Attributes of the merged lot default from the largest contributing lot
    Lot merging and splitting are executed from the Oracle Mobile Transactions: Lot Split, and Lot Merge
    Lot geneology tracks lot merging and lot splitting transactions in a geneology window
    Serialized items allow tracking of individual items in inventory as well tracking as their 'as-built' configurations
    Serial attributes include standard and user defined values to track individual item information
    'As-Built' configurations are multilevel records of the actual items, lots and serial numbers of items. Serial numbers are entered in the Serial Entry Form
    The Quantity Tree is a hierarchical structure of available quantities for items. Hierarchy top to bottom is: Item/Revision/Lot/SubInv/Locator/LPN. Qty's tracked are: on-hand, reservable, reserved, suggested, available to transact, available to reserve
    There is a public interface to the quantity tree for third party applications: INV_QUANTITY_TREE_PUB.QUERY_QUANTITIES
    Reservations are associations between supply and demand. Viewed through the Item Reservation form
    Consignment Inventory can be implemented as commingled inventory using cost groups and rules, rather than default subinventory account values
    The Rules Framework can be setup to choose values for: pick, putaway, labeling, cost group assignment, and task management such as task type assignment (these are rule types) - on the WMS Rules form
    Rules are established as complex expressions (or/and) for multiple lines comparing business objects and values to constants or other business objects and values
    Rules are grouped into strategies and strategies are tied to named business objects to fire the rules. If no rule fires, default org assignments are used to determine accounts, pick and putaway locations
    Physical inventory count methods include cycle count (which relies on ABC prioritization) and physical count.
    ABC (meaning count in classes A, B, C where A has the most value/impact) Analysis provides count guidelines based on content scope (inventory org or subinventory included) and valuation scope (inv org or sub org used as scope for determining value rank) using the ABC Compile form
    Content scope decides what items are included in the ABC inventory. Valuation scope decides what inventories are included in ranking the relative value of the items in the content scope
    ABC Criteria on the ABC Compile form provide a range of criteria to select. Quantity criteria rank in terms of FSN, and value criteria rank in terms of usage value (quantity times unit price)
    ABC Classes are predefined cycle counts. The compile is defined and linked to the class to provide a definition for each class
    Hit or Miss reporting on cycle counts includes all items as hits if the count is within the defined tolerance, and a miss if the count is outside the tolerance
    Count requests are specific OWM tasks to perform counts and are generated by the Count Request concurrent process after cycle counting is scheduled
    Min-Max or Reorder-Point planning is set at the item level - on the General Planning tab. It can be one method or the other, not both
    Reorder Point Planning is set at the item level using the Inventory Planning Method attribute and related parameters. Reorder is defined as safety stock plus forecast demand during reorder lead time. Reorder quantity is calculated using the standard EOQ formula
    Safety stock is set on the item attributes on the planning tab.
    Replenishment counting can be used where perpetual inventories are not maintained - by entering counts and generating reorder calculations (on items such as supply items)
    Labeling consists of label types and formats. Type dictate the data contents of a label and each type has multiple formats but only one default format.
    Containers are items - tagged as a container on the Physical Attributes tab of item attributes. LPN's provide serial number control over containers but the same LPN's can be assigned to different containers over their lifetime
    Cartonization is the process of packing items into containers to match the loading restrictions of the containers.
    Container transactions allow dealing with containers as units without reference to the contents. Includes prepack, move (referencing the LPN) and unpack transactions.
    Warehouse tasks identify resources, locations and activities to perform. Processes such as picking and cycle count generate tasks to complete these activities.
    Task types define resources needed for tasks (eg pallet trucks) and task types are assigned to tasks using the task type assignment engine. Task type assignment rules are part of the rules framework
    Label types are assigned to warehouse business flows and each business flow triggers label generation by selecting the default label for the label type
    Cross docking (if enabled for the org) will suggest moving any receiving goods that are back ordered be moved to a shipping dock immediately, unless it is rejected on receipt inspection
    Pick execution has three supported modes: system directed (based on the rules engine, each new pick is determined to match your pick resources), manual picking (pick lines are followed for a pick slip), and label based (for conveyors where cartons are loaded and moved down a pick line)
    Picking methods in a warehouse include: order, cluster, zone, build, paper-based, pick and pass, and wave (consolidated multi-order picking)

Warehouse Management System (WMS) Notes on Kanban:
    Kanban means sign/signal - applies to decentralized inventory management of items with stable demand and medium to high volume
    Pull sequences for Kanbans are defined for each item and subinventory/locator combination (usage point) - they define the replenishment source for each source type (production/supplier/intra-org/inter-org)
    Kanban size or number of cards is calculated by the system when the other value is input (unless the 'do not calculate' option is enabled) based on lead time to resupply and physical container constraints (plus min re-order quantity, lot multipler, safety stock days, and allocation percent)

Work in Process (WIP) Notes:
    WIP accepts planning workorders from MRP and tracks actual completions data in manufacturing as well as actual resources and waste/scrap.
    WIP uses BOM information as a 'budget' in creating the actual WIP work order
    Work orders in WIP describe how many items to make, when the assemblies are supposed to be completed and where to put the finished assemblies
    Discrete jobs are the same thing as workorders and production orders. Generated by discrete planning and sales orders.
    WIP accounts for most functionality in Manufacturing Execution: involves work orders, jobs, operations, scheduled dates
    OSFM provides additional WIP functionality for lot based manufacturing like semiconductors
    Discrete jobs or manufacturing work orders are generated from planning (MRP, ASCP) or from sales orders
    Unplanned work in manufacturing can be rework and prototypes
    Backflushing is automatic inventory relief based on job completion, operation completion or work orderless completion
    The backflush is automatically executed when a job completes (for any 'assembly pull' material) or when an operation completes (for any 'operation pull' material)
    For flow manufacturing there are flow schedules but no work orders or discrete jobs.
    The progress on a job is recorded using 'movements' between operations or 'intra-operation' movements, based on routings
    Jobs are charged material costs and labor costs and overheads (resources) as each operation is completed (autocharging)
    Jobs or schedules (for flow or repetitive mfg) are 'completed' adding to finished goods. Flow uses work orderless completions
    Jobs are created from snapshots of their BOM's, extended by the quantity of the job to estimate material requirements
    WIP Supply Type drives material issue: 'push' for issued material, 'operation pull' for backflushed material after an operation, and 'assembly pull' for backflushed material after an assembly is completed
    Jobs are scheduled by assigning start and end dates to each operation (or the first and last operation for repetitive jobs)
    Jobs are copied with the required resources for each operation, for each resource type: labor, materials, overhead.
    There are five intra-operaton steps or stages: queue (wait to start), run (in process), to (complete and wait to exit), scrap (complete and in scrap), reject (complete and held pending move to rework or scrap)
    Production methods are: discrete (MTS), repetitive, flow, ATO and CTO
    Shop floor statuses can be defined as hold statuses, and attached to steps (stages within a sequence) in jobs to force a hold for QA or other purposes
    Discrepant material is material that fails inspection and must be isolated and ultimately returned to a vendor or reworked
    Discrete jobs are created by: releasing planned orders, autocreating from ATO/CTO sales orders, by open interface, or manually
    Discrete job statuses are: unreleased, released, complete, complete-no charges, closed, hold and cancelled
    Repetitive schedules require a production line to be defined first and then associate repetitive assemblies to the line
    Tolerance fences on production lines define the percent increase in production possible for a given number of lead days
    WIP materials must be specifically issued to a discrete job using the WIP Material Transactions form
    Backflushing relieves inventory of components after the assembly is complete - it assumes that completed components mean materials were issued.
    Post-deduct and backflush are the same thing.
    Work orderless completions backflush all materials: push, assembly pull and operation pull. It won't backflush bulk or vendor supplied items
    By product recovery is accomplished with negative quantities in the BOM: backflushing sends these byproducts to inventory, as does explicit material issue
    Phantom assemblies are collections of parts that may exist in many products - changing the phantom updates all products. Phantoms are not inventoried.
    A dispatch list is a report of scheduled work by department to guide shop floor work
    A job packet or job traveller is attached to an assembly as it is built - including a routing of operations, a BOM of materials, and drawings.
    The Discrete Job Routing Sheet is the primary traveller report in Oracle WIP (online version is Discrete Workstation form)
    Overcompletion is when more unit of an assembly are moved than are available. Overcompletion tolerances for items limit the percentage of overcompletion
    Completions move WIP to inventory: use completion moves for discrete jobs and work orderless completions for flow routings.
    Discrete jobs are ultimately closed to post variances to the GL for differences between BOM budgeted amounts and WIP actual completed amounts for materials and resource usage.
    Repetitive jobs are only completed - never closed

    Move Lot Based Jobs -> WORK IN PROCESS/.... - to record moves between operations for lot based jobs
    Inventory Lot Transactions -> WORK IN PROCESS/...... - to split lots, merge lots, translate lots (to a different BOM/product), transfer lots to different subinventory.
    Completion Transactions -> WORK IN PROCESS/Material Transactions/Completion Transactions - to complete WIP jobs to inventory
    Work Orderless Completions -> WORK IN PROCESS/Material Transactions/Work Orderless Completions - to complete flow manufacturing schedules
    Flow Workstation -> FLOW MANUFACTURING/Production/Flow Workstation (counterpart of Discrete Workstation) - shows flow status and links to transaction forms
    Close Discrete Jobs -> WORK IN PROCESS/Discrete/Close Discrete Jobs/Close Discrete Jobs (Form)....
    Purge Discrete Jobs -> WORK IN PROCESS/Discrete/Purge Discrete Jobs/.... to purge jobs after the accounting period is closed and jobs are closed.

Workflow (WF) (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Tips and Tricks:
    Restart an errored workflow by clearing the cause of the error then rewinding the workflow to a prior point
        Workflow Administrator -> Status Monitor -> Search for Item -> Rewind -> Choose Point to Rewind To
        This will resume processing at an earlier point in the workflow
    Run workflows by choosing the Workflow Administrator Responsibility, then
        choose 'Workflow Background Process' and specify the workflow parameters
            This will run workflow actions in deferred status
    Always Log onto Workflow Builder as "Apps" to get grants to all needed tables,
        otherwise you get errors like "Unable to set NLS_LANGUAGE.".
            ORA-000942: table or view does not exist.
    The workflow administrator role must be set to a responsibility that you are assigned,
        in order to modify other people's workflows - see workflow scripts below
    If the workflow admin role is a responsibility that you are not assigned ...
       you will not be able to see workflow items.
    To see and change the Workflow Administrator, find the current value (it can be a user or responsibility) -see scripts below
        select text from APPLSYS.WF_RESOURCES where name = 'WF_ADMIN_ROLE'
        Log in using the current value user or responsibility
        If you log in as a user workflow administrator, choose 'Workflow Administrator Web Applications' and go to Administer Workflow > Administration
            See and change the value of Workflow System Administrator
        Patches often over-ride non-default settings and need to be reset
    Verify workflow and the notification mailer through the Oracle Applications Manager
        Navigate to Workflow Manager within OAM from the Application Dashboard page.
    You cannot use a URL to view a report provided by a workflow notice more than once
        See metalink note 77576.1 - using the link a second time will cause an 'authentication failure'
    You can set another person's vacation rules if the leave w/out doing it themselves
        Navigation: Workflow  (Administration) -> Administrator Workflow -> Administration -> Vacation Rules (in menu)
    You can redirect a notification on an existing workflow if a person is out
        Workflow Adminstration -> Status Monitor -> Activity History -> Activity -> Reassign

Workflow (WF) Notes on General Functions
    Workflow is part of AOL and prescribes how different types of information flow among people
        in accordance with business rules
    Workflow is primarily used for approval processes and Account Generater within the apps
    Components of Oracle Workflow are:
        Builder (client),
        Monitor (client tier),
        Definitions Loader (for text file definitions),
        Notifications Mailer and Directory Services (apps tier - send and receive email notifications),
        Engine (db tier) and
        Notification Server (db tier)
    Workflow Notification Mailer and Directory Services performs the following:
        maintains users,
        maintains roles (users or groups of users or positions) and
        maintains user/role cross references for routing notifications to roles (user names)
    Workflow Engine is a PL/SQL program on the server which executes the workflow process and monitors the workflow state
        It includes an event manager that triggers any subscribed activity/function to an event
        It provides callable services that may be needed by PL/SQL functions which execute activities
    The workflow engine supports rules such as looping, branching, parallel flows and subflows
    Workflow Monitor provides a graphical status on a workflow, allows expediting or restarting a workflow
        Workflow Monitor provides detailed information on the attributes of a workflow.
        It is primarily used by the Workflow System Administrator
    Workflow Definitions Loader allows uploading or downloading workflow definitions from the database or text files
        It can also load definitions from a development instance to a test or production instance
    Workflow rules (aka process definitions) include:
        activities that occur in a process and
        the relationships/dependencies between those activities
    An instance of a workflow is a specific item travelling through the workflow
        e.g. PO in an approval process
        there may be many instances of a single workflow active at any time
    Each instance or item of a workflow has a number of data attributes that describe
        the state of the instance in the workflow based on the status of each activity
    The state of an item or instance of a workflow at any one time is defined by
        the status of all the activities for that instance of the workflow
        some activities may be complete and some may not, one may be active
    Each activity in a workflow can have one of the following states for each instance:
        Active,
        Complete,
        Deferred,
        Error,
        Notified,
        Suspended, and
        Waiting
    Transition occurs when an activity returns a status of complete to the Workflow Engine
        the engine will then set to active the next dependent activity in the workflow definition and execute that activity.
    If the final activity returns a complete status, the Engine will mark the entire workflow instance as complete
    An incomplete workflow can be restarted by clicking the start button on the workflow Monitor diagram
    The default workflow administrator is the System Administrator
        this can be changed in the global preferences of the system admin menu (Sysadmin/Workflow/Global Preferences)
    Seeded workflows stored on the database can be accessed using File/Open on the Workflow builder
        You need a TNS Names database connection string (same as SQL Plus) and user id/password to download workflows
    If an activity returns an error to the workflow engine:
        the engine rolls back the activity and executes error functions at the lowest level, or
            at successive parent workflow levels until it reaches the default highest level workflow error handler
    Exercise: Check for suspended notifications -> WFA/Find Processes, and choose item type
        (purchase order notifications begin with PO...)

Workflow (WF) (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Workflow Builder and Message Designer:
    Log onto workflow builder with the apps userid or you will not get access - you will get an NLS_LANGUAGE error
    Workflow Builder Clients are available on My Oracle Support as follows:
        How To Download and Install the Latest Oracle Workflow Builder (Client Tool) and XML Gateway Message Designer for E-Business [ID 261028.1]
        Recommended Set Up for Client/Server Products with Oracle E-Business Suite 11i and R12 (Doc ID 277535.1)
            Oracle Workflow Client 2.6.3.5 for Microsoft Windows is Patch 4096620 for R12
            Oracle Workflow Client 2.6.3.0 for Microsoft Windows is Patch 4066964 for 11i

Workflow (WF) (APPLSYS Schema) Notes on Item Type Property:
    Each item type has six major properties shown as branches in the Workflow Buider Navigator Window
        Attributes, Processes, Notifications, Functions, Events, Messages and Lookup Types
    Workflow also has an "Activities" concept - an activity is a node in the workflow
        An activity can be a notification, process or function
    Attributes: are the data value holders for the item type
        e.g. 'Requisition Number' or 'PO Approval Limit'.
        These attributes hold the data associated with the individual items
    Processes (Activities): are the activities that the workflow item transitions into and out of
        The full set of activities constitutes the overall workflow performed
    Notifications (Activities): are the notifications within the current item type.
        Notifications send messages to user roles and prompt for simple responses.
    Functions (Activities): are stored PL/SQL procedures that are executed.
    Event Activities): are business events that the item type will receive, process or raise and send/notify
    Messages: are text that a notificatin activity can send to a user role
    Lookup Types: are lists of valid values used by notifications or messages

Workflow (WF) (APPLSYS Schema) Notes Finding and Monitoring Workflows and Notifications:
    You must know the workflow item type (or user item type) and the workflow key
        The workflow item key is a unique identifier for an item type
        The workflow item key is built differently for each workflow item type
        Examples of workflow item keys are:
            Purchase Orders -> WF_ITEM_KEY  in PO.PO_HEADERS_ALL
                Build with PO_HEADER_ID & sequence number (e.g. '3702-147435')
                WF_ITEM_TYPE = 'POAPPRV'
            Requisitions -> WF_ITEM_KEY in PO.PO_REQUISITION_HEADERS_ALL
                Built with REQUISITION_HEADER_ID and a sequence number
                WF_ITEM_TYPE = 'REQAPPRV'
        The key can be found from the Workflow Status page within each application
    Alternatively query the WF_ITEMS table based on Item Type, beginning and ending dates
    Monitor the workflow from the Workflow Administrator responsibility
    Exercise: Monitor workflow item ->
        Workflow Administrator/Administrator Workflow/Status Monitor
    Find a Notification and Force a Response
        Log on as SYSADMIN or change the Workflow Administrator to your User or to Global ('*')
        Navigation: 'Workflow Administrator Web (New)' > Administration > Notification Search and search for the notification (see attached doc for the search values) and act on the notification

Workflow (WF) Notes on Notfication/Delegation Rules (also known as Vacation Rules) and Worklist Access
    You can create Vacation Rules for others via Workflow Administration
        Navigation: Workflow  (Administration) -> Administrator Workflow -> Administration -> Vacation Rules (in menu)
    Workflow notification rules can be established to respond to notifications automatically
        These include: cancel, redirect or respond
    Exercise: Enter a notification rule -> WFA/Notification Rules,
        and enter new notification rules for specific workflow item types and notifications
    Worklist Access allows other users to access a user's worklist - notifications are not redirected

Workflow (WF) Notes on Roles:
    Roles cannot be defined in the Workflow Builder and can only be referenced from the Oracle applications database
        This is where they are defined
    A performer associated with an activity like a notification translates into a role
        Or it can by an item type attribute that dynamically translates into a role

Workflow (WF) Notes on Customization Levels and Protection Levels
    Each workflow has a customization level (default is zero) and protection level (default is 1000)
    Your access level must be between these two values if you want to modify the workflow

Workflow (WF) Notes on Scripts
    Workflow scripts have a .wft extension and can be saved on the local host file system
    They are also saved on the database (Use File/Open/Database within Workflow Builder)
    The WFLOAD file system script can be used to upload or download .wft files on the database
        The syntax is WFLOAD <apps/pwd> 0 Y {UPLOAD|DOWNLOAD|UPGRADE|FORCE} <filepath> [<item type>]
            The <item type> is only used with the DOWNLOAD mode
    To find the current workflow administrator use this SQL:
        select text from APPLSYS.WF_RESOURCES where name = 'WF_ADMIN_ROLE'
        The result is applicationID/responsibilityID - the workflow administrator can be either
    The base application workflows are generally stored in "<APP_TOP>/admin/import" directory

Workflow (WF Schema) Notes on Workflow Directory Services
    New users are created in WF_LOCAL_ROLES with USER_FLAG set to 'Y'
    New responsibilities are created in WF_LOCAL_ROLES with USER_FLAG set to 'N'
    Associations between users and responsibilities are in WF_LOCAL_USER_ROLES
        The user is in USER_NAME and the responsibility is in ROLE_NAME
        The responsibility can be found by querying DISPLAY_NAME and NAME in WF_LOCAL_ROLES
    Views in the APPS schema based on these tables are WF_USERS and WF_ROLES

Workflow (WF) Notes on Concurrent Processes:
    Workflow Background Process - from the WFA responsibility.
        Run two processes scheduled every 5-15 mins for
        1) timed out processes,
        2) deferred processes (these are program parameters)
    Workflow Background Process - options are:
        item type,
        min threshhold (0),
        max threshhold (100),
        process deferred (yes),
        process timeout (yes),
        process stuck (yes).
    Synchronize WF Local Tables
        updates the WF_LOCAL_X tables from the Oracle apps tables to register new users and employees in workflow

Workflow (WF) Notes on Key Packages:
    WR_ENGINE - contains all the workflow engine API's

Workflow (WF) Notes on Key Tables:
    WF_ITEM_TYPES (and _TL) - contains workflow item types
    WF_ITEMS - instances of item types - actual workflow occurances
    WF_MESSAGES (and _TL) - workflow messages
    WF_USERS - are people in the superset of the various application tables like PER_PERSON_F and FND_USERS
    WF_ROLES - contains the information on workflow roles
    WF_USER_ROLES - tags users to roles. Workflow works with roles and sends notifications to users within those roles
    WF_USER_ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS - table that underlies the view WF_LOCAL_USER_ROLES
    WF_NOTIFICATIONS - holds all notifications (until purged) for each item type
    WF_NOTIFICATION_ATTRIBUTES - carries one line for each attribute defined for a single notification
    WF_RESOURCES - stores the Workflow Administrator against name = 'WF_ADMIN_ROLE' and all form headings and form error messages

Workflow (WF) Notes on Technical Configuration and Versions:
    For custom workflows, the code is under ORACLE_HOME/wf directory an the applications server
    For Oracle applications, the code is under $FND_TOP directory for the application
    Workflow version 2.6 is the latest available version but only as a standalone.
        WF 2.5 is embedded in the applications
    Release 11.0 of Applications uses Workflow Ver 2.0.3
    Release 11.5 (11i) uses Workflow Ver 2.5 (more recently 2.6)
    Version 2.0.X and Versions 2.5/2.6 are not compatible
    wfver.sql displays the version of workflow installed with the applications

XML Gateway (ECX Schema) Notes in Message Designer Installation
    Oracle Workflow Client 2.6.3.0 for Microsoft Windows is Patch 4066964 for 11i
    It is not included in the Worflow client patch for R12 which is Patch 4096620
    See "How To Download and Install the Latest Oracle Workflow Builder (Client Tool) and XML Gateway Message Designer for E-Business [ID 261028.1]"

XML Gateway General Notes:
    XML Gateway is an Http protocol tool for Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Business to Business (B2B),
        Application to Application (A2A) and web service integration
    XML Gateway provides a set of services to send and receive XML formatted records
        It can send from the Oracle applications and receive to the Oracle standard interface tables
    XML processing is real time and event driven, whereas EDI (via eCommerce gateway) is batch oriented
    XML Gateway supports all standards for Document Type Definitions (DTD's)
        These include: RosettaNet, Open Applications Group (OAG), SOAP and iFX
    XML Gateway works with the Oracle Workflow Business Event System (BES) to create event based messages
        It can also 'consume' incoming messages for processing
        BES utilizes publish and subscribe features to create and consume messages
        BES is implemented through Oracle Workflow and Oracle Advanced Queuing (AQ)
            Workflow creates business events and places them on the queue for processing
            Business events can be raised (added to the queue) or received (taken off the queue)
    XML Gateway feeds Oracle Advanced Queuing to send XML messages and subcribe to inbound messages
        It also uses Oracle Transport Layer (OTL) for message transmission.
            The Oracle Transport Layer (OXTA) monitors the outbound queue (ECX_OUTBOUND) and sends out the documents
            The documents are sent based on the information that is included in the document itself
            OXTA can send documents in HTTP, HTTPS and SMTP protocol formats
    The Advanced Queuing Engine uses the Transport Layer for confirmation of delivery and recipient authentication
    XML Gateway can support business to business integration as well as Application to Application (A2A) integration
        Both types of integration can be accomplished within the same environment
        A2A integration can be between Oracle Applications and legacy systems
    Primary components are: Message Designer, Execution Engine, Trading Partner Directory Service,
        Message Setup, Workflow Integration for Error Handling, Advanced Queuing Integration,
            and Servlet Based Transport Agent
        Message Designer is a visual message mapping tool that maps source formats to target formats for data conversion
            It supports XML to XML and Table/View to XML
            The XML portion of the map can be based on an actual XML message, or a DTD (Data Type Definition)
            Message Designer maps the structure of the source and target messages (level hierarchy)
            Message Designer also maps the individual element mapping and needed transformations, such as formatting and masking
            Data mapping can be conditional, string oriented, mathematical and date conversion types
        The Execution Engine uses the finalized message maps as the mechanism for processing incoming or outbound message transformations.
            The Execution Engine process includes: Validating the Trading Partner, Retrieving the Message Map, Retrieve the Message,
                Apply Transformations, Validate XML Using a Parser, Enqueue and Dequeue Messages, and Transmit Confirmations
    Message definitions are provided for some pre-built messages to use immediately
        Oracle XML Gateway supports all DTD based XML standards
            including the OAG (Open Application Group) standard as the default standard for pre-built messages
        Any prebuilt message can be modified by remapping to serve local needs
    Meta data is used to build the outbound message
        Metadata is obtained from the XML Gateway repositories: trading partner, message maps, process controls, data transformation rules,
            Syntax and semantic validation rules
        Changes to the message can be achieved by changing the mapping in the meta data definitions.
            Changes take effect at runtime without any code modifications
    Monitoring transaction activity can be accomplished using the Transaction Monitor or by using Workflow notifications
        Notifications can go to the e-Business Suite administrator or the Trading Partner
        Notifications provide the option to abort or retry message processing
        If aborted, errors must be corrected at the source to maintain a complete audit trail
    Flat files are handled via the e-Commerce gateway to extract or import flat files of repeated records
        Flat files require a third party EDI translator if the output or input to e-Commerced Gateway is EDI transactions

XML Gateway (ECX Schema) Setup Notes
    A trading partner is set up and can be a hub or an individual business partner.
        Definition includes:name, enabled messages, confirmation, message maps, email address for error notices,
            partner specific code conversions, and transport protocol (HTTP, SMTP, HTTPS)
    Code conversions are lookup values that transform Oracle codes to meaningful trading partner codes, or vice versa
        Code conversion categories are assigned to messages in the 'Category' column of message designer
    All the buyers and sellers within a hub are defined and linked to the hub trading partner record
    Transaction names are cross-referenced so that Oracle names can be transformed into trading partner names for outgoing messages
        Reverse cross-references can be created for incoming messages

XML Gateway (ECX Schema) Forms
    Inbound posting form
    Document Transfer Summary -- for outbound documents in Receivables Manager (under Print Documents)

XML Gateway (ECX Schema) Profile Options
    ECX: Log File Path - application level profile option, holds the destination ECX system log files

XML Gateway (ECX Schema) Tables and views
    ECX_INQUEUE -- stores a transaction record for each inbound XML post
    ECX_INBOUND_LOG -- stores log messages for inbound activity
    ECX_IN_OAG_Q_TABLE -- stores a transaction for inbound OAG compliant transactions
    ECX_TP_DETAILS_V -- a view of everything
    ECX_TP_HEADERS -- trading partner headers
    ECX_TP_DETAILS -- trading partner details
    ECX_DTDS -- DTDs

XML Gateway (ECX Schema) Notes on Troubleshooting
    The troubleshooting guide on Metalink is Doc 167474.1 "XML Troubleshooting Guide"
    An XML Gateway test posting page can be used to post XML to the Gateway, receive a confirmation and Message ID.
    The Message ID is tagged to the XML transactions in the internal ECX tables
    ECX_OXTA_LOGMSG holds ecx log for timeout messages
    Open 'Document Transfer Summary' form to view status of AR documents sent to customers
